Preface

Thermodynamics, a key component of many fields of science and engineering, is based
on laws of universal applicability. However, the most important applications of those laws,
and the materials and processes of greatest concern, differ from one branch of science or engineering to another. Thus, we believe there is value in presenting this material from a chemical-­
engineering perspective, focusing on the application of thermodynamic principles to materials
and processes most likely to be encountered by chemical engineers.
Although introductory in nature, the material of this text should not be considered simple. Indeed, there is no way to make it simple. A student new to the subject will find that a
demanding task of discovery lies ahead. New concepts, words, and symbols appear at a bewildering rate, and a degree of memorization and mental organization is required. A far greater
challenge is to develop the capacity to reason in the context of thermodynamics so that one
can apply thermodynamic principles in the solution of practical problems. While maintaining
the rigor characteristic of sound thermodynamic analysis, we have made every effort to avoid
unnecessary mathematical complexity. Moreover, we aim to encourage understanding by writing in simple active-voice, present-tense prose. We can hardly supply the required motivation,
but our objective, as it has been for all previous editions, is a treatment that may be understood
by any student willing to put forth the required effort.
The text is structured to alternate between the development of thermodynamic principles and the correlation and use of thermodynamic properties as well as between theory and
applications. The first two chapters of the book present basic definitions and a development of
the first law of thermodynamics. Chapters 3 and 4 then treat the pressure/volume/­temperature
behavior of fluids and heat effects associated with temperature change, phase change, and
chemical reaction, allowing early application of the first law to realistic problems. The second law is developed in Chap. 5, where its most basic applications are also introduced. A full
treatment of the thermodynamic properties of pure fluids in Chap. 6 allows general application of the first and second laws, and provides for an expanded treatment of flow processes
in Chap. 7. Chapters 8 and 9 deal with power production and refrigeration processes. The
xiii

xiv

Preface

remainder of the book, concerned with fluid mixtures, treats topics in the unique domain
of chemical-­engineering thermodynamics. Chapter 10 introduces the framework of solution
thermodynamics, which underlies the applications in the following chapters. Chapter 12 then
describes the analysis of phase equilibria, in a mostly qualitative manner. Chapter 13 provides
full treatment of vapor/liquid equilibrium. Chemical-reaction equilibrium is covered at length
in Chap. 14. Chapter 15 deals with topics in phase equilibria, including liquid/liquid, solid/
liquid, solid/vapor, gas adsorption, and osmotic equilibria. Chapter 16 treats the thermodynamic analysis of real processes, affording a review of much of the practical subject matter of
thermodynamics.
The material of these 16 chapters is more than adequate for an academic-year undergraduate course, and discretion, conditioned by the content of other courses, is required in the
choice of what is covered. The first 14 chapters include material considered necessary to any
chemical engineer’s education. Where only a single-semester course in chemical engineering
thermodynamics is provided, these chapters may represent sufficient content.
The book is comprehensive enough to make it a useful reference both in graduate courses
and for professional practice. However, length considerations have required a prudent selectivity. Thus, we do not include certain topics that are worthy of attention but are of a specialized
nature. These include applications to polymers, electrolytes, and biomaterials.
We are indebted to many people—students, professors, reviewers—who have contributed in various ways to the quality of this eighth edition, directly and indirectly, through question and comment, praise and criticism, through seven previous editions spanning more than
65 years.
We would like to thank McGraw-Hill Education and all of the teams that contributed to
the development and support of this project. In particular, we would like to thank the following
editorial and production staff for their essential contributions to this eighth edition: Thomas
Scaife, Chelsea Haupt, Nick McFadden, and Laura Bies. We would also like to thank Professor
Bharat Bhatt for his much appreciated comments and advice during the accuracy check.
To all we extend our thanks.

A brief explanation of the authorship of the eighth edition
In December 2003, I received an unexpected e-mail from Hank Van Ness that began as follows: “I’m sure this message comes as a surprise you; so let me state immediately its purpose.
We would like to invite you to discuss the possibility that you join us as the 4th author . . . of
Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics.” I met with Hank and with Mike
Abbott in summer 2004, and began working with them on the eighth edition in earnest almost
immediately after the seventh edition was published in 2005. Unfortunately, the following
years witnessed the deaths of Michael Abbott (2006), Hank Van Ness (2008), and Joe Smith
(2009) in close succession. In the months preceding his death, Hank Van Ness worked diligently on revisions to this textbook. The reordering of content and overall structure of this
eighth edition reflect his vision for the book.

I am sure Joe, Hank, and Michael would all be delighted to see this eighth edition in
print and, for the first time, in a fully electronic version including Connect and SmartBook.
I am both humbled and honored to have been entrusted with the task of revising this classic
textbook, which by the time I was born had already been used by a generation of chemical
engineering students. I hope that the changes we have made, from content revision and re-­
ordering to the addition of more structured chapter introductions and a concise synopsis at
the end of each chapter, will improve the experience of using this text for the next generation
of students, while maintaining the essential character of the text, which has made it the mostused chemical engineering textbook of all time. I look forward to receiving your feedback on
the changes that have been made and those that you would like to see in the future, as well as
what additional resources would be of most value in supporting your use of the text.

Introduction

By way of introduction, in this chapter we outline the origin of thermodynamics and its present scope. We also review a number of familiar, but basic, scientific concepts essential to the
subject:
∙ Dimensions and units of measure
∙ Force and pressure
∙ Temperature
∙ Work and heat
∙ Mechanical energy and its conservation

1.1

THE SCOPE OF THERMODYNAMICS

The science of thermodynamics was developed in the 19th century as a result of the need to
describe the basic operating principles of the newly invented steam engine and to provide a
basis for relating the work produced to the heat supplied. Thus the name itself denotes power
generated from heat. From the study of steam engines, there emerged two of the primary generalizations of science: the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. All of classical thermodynamics is implicit in these laws. Their statements are very simple, but their implications
are profound.
The First Law simply says that energy is conserved, meaning that it is neither created
nor destroyed. It provides no definition of energy that is both general and precise. No help
comes from its common informal use where the word has imprecise meanings. However, in
scientific and engineering contexts, energy is recognized as appearing in various forms, useful because each form has mathematical definition as a function of some recognizable and
measurable characteristics of the real world. Thus kinetic energy is defined as a function of
velocity, and gravitational potential energy as a function of elevation.
Conservation implies the transformation of one form of energy into another. Windmills
have long operated to transform the kinetic energy of the wind into work that is used to raise
1

2

CHAPTER 1. Introduction

water from land lying below sea level. The overall effect is to convert the kinetic energy of the
wind into potential energy of water. Wind energy is now more widely converted to electrical
energy. Similarly, the potential energy of water has long been transformed into work used to
grind grain or saw lumber. Hydroelectric plants are now a significant source of electrical power.
The Second Law is more difficult to comprehend because it depends on entropy, a word
and concept not in everyday use. Its consequences in daily life are significant with respect to
environmental conservation and efficient use of energy. Formal treatment is postponed until
we have laid a proper foundation.
The two laws of thermodynamics have no proof in a mathematical sense. However, they
are universally observed to be obeyed. An enormous volume of experimental evidence demonstrates their validity. Thus, thermodynamics shares with mechanics and electromagnetism a
basis in primitive laws.
These laws lead, through mathematical deduction, to a network of equations that find
application in all branches of science and engineering. Included are calculation of heat and
work requirements for physical, chemical, and biological processes, and the determination of
equilibrium conditions for chemical reactions and for the transfer of chemical species between
phases. Practical application of these equations almost always requires information on the
properties of materials. Thus, the study and application of thermodynamics is inextricably
linked with the tabulation, correlation, and prediction of properties of substances. Fig. 1.1
illustrates schematically how the two laws of thermodynamics are combined with information
on material properties to yield useful analyses of, and predictions about, physical, chemical,
and biological systems. It also notes the chapters of this text that treat each component.

properties to produce useful predictions and analyses.

Examples of questions that can be answered on the basis of the laws of thermodynamics
combined with property information include the following:
∙ How much energy is released when a liter of ethanol is burned (or metabolized)?
∙ What maximum flame temperature can be reached when ethanol is burned in air?

1.1. The Scope of Thermodynamics

∙ What maximum fraction of the heat released in an ethanol flame can be converted to
electrical energy or work?
∙ How do the answers to the preceding two questions change if the ethanol is burned with
pure oxygen, rather than air?
∙ What is the maximum amount of electrical energy that can be produced when a liter of
ethanol is reacted with O2 to produce CO2 and water in a fuel cell?
∙ In the distillation of an ethanol/water mixture, how are the vapor and liquid compositions related?
∙ When water and ethylene react at high pressure and temperature to produce ethanol,
what are the compositions of the phases that result?
∙ How much ethylene is contained in a high-pressure gas cylinder for given temperature,
pressure, and volume?
∙ When ethanol is added to a two-phase system containing toluene and water, how much
ethanol goes into each phase?
∙ If a water/ethanol mixture is partially frozen, what are the compositions of the liquid and
solid phases?
∙ What volume of solution results from mixing one liter of ethanol with one liter of water?
(It is not exactly 2 liters!)
The application of thermodynamics to any real problem starts with the specification of
a particular region of space or body of matter designated as the system. Everything outside
the system is called the surroundings. The system and surroundings interact through transfer
of material and energy across the system boundaries, but the system is the focus of attention.
Many different thermodynamic systems are of interest. A pure vapor such as steam is the
working medium of a power plant. A reacting mixture of fuel and air powers an internal-­
combustion engine. A vaporizing liquid provides refrigeration. Expanding gases in a nozzle
propel a rocket. The metabolism of food provides the nourishment for life.
Once a system has been selected, we must describe its state. There are two possible
points of view, the macroscopic and the microscopic. The former relates to quantities such
as composition, density, temperature, and pressure. These macroscopic coordinates require
no assumptions regarding the structure of matter. They are few in number, are suggested by
our sense perceptions, and are measured with relative ease. A macroscopic description thus
requires specification of a few fundamental measurable properties. The macroscopic point of
view, as adopted in classical thermodynamics, reveals nothing of the microscopic (molecular)
mechanisms of physical, chemical, or biological processes.
A microscopic description depends on the existence and behavior of molecules, is
not directly related to our sense perceptions, and treats quantities that cannot routinely be
directly measured. Nevertheless, it offers insight into material behavior and contributes to
evaluation of thermodynamic properties. Bridging the length and time scales between the
microscopic behavior of molecules and the macroscopic world is the subject of statistical
mechanics or statistical thermodynamics, which applies the laws of quantum mechanics and
classical mechanics to large ensembles of atoms, molecules, or other elementary objects to
predict and interpret macroscopic behavior. Although we make occasional reference to the

4

molecular basis for observed material properties, the subject of statistical thermodynamics is
not treated in this book.1

1.2

INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

Descriptions of thermodynamic states depend on the fundamental dimensions of science,
of which length, time, mass, temperature, and amount of substance are of greatest interest
here. These dimensions are primitives, recognized through our sensory perceptions, and
are not definable in terms of anything simpler. Their use, however, requires the definition
of arbitrary scales of measure, divided into specific units of size. Primary units have been
set by international agreement, and are codified as the International System of Units (abbreviated SI, for Système International).2 This is the primary system of units used throughout
this book.
The second, symbol s, the SI unit of time, is the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of
radiation associated with a specified transition of the cesium atom. The meter, symbol m,
is the fundamental unit of length, defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum during
1/299,792,458 of a second. The kilogram, symbol kg, is the basic unit of mass, defined as the
mass of a platinum/iridium cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
at Sèvres, France.3 (The gram, symbol g, is 0.001 kg.) Temperature is a characteristic dimension of thermodynamics, and is measured on the Kelvin scale, as described in Sec. 1.4. The
mole, symbol mol, is defined as the amount of a substance represented by as many elementary
entities (e.g., molecules) as there are atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.
The SI unit of force is the newton, symbol N, derived from Newton’s second law, which
expresses force F as the product of mass m and acceleration a: F = ma. Thus, a newton is the
force that, when applied to a mass of 1 kg, produces an acceleration of 1 m·s−2, and is therefore a unit representing 1 kg·m·s−2. This illustrates a key feature of the SI system, namely, that
derived units always reduce to combinations of primary units. Pressure P (Sec. 1.5), defined
as the normal force exerted by a fluid on a unit area of surface, is expressed in pascals, symbol Pa. With force in newtons and area in square meters, 1 Pa is equivalent to 1 N·m−2 or
1 kg·m−1·s−2. Essential to thermodynamics is the derived unit for energy, the joule, symbol J,
defined as 1 N·m or 1 kg·m2·s−2.
Multiples and decimal fractions of SI units are designated by prefixes, with symbol abbreviations, as listed in Table 1.1. Common examples of their use are the centimeter, 1 cm = 10−2 m,
the kilopascal, 1 kPa = 103 Pa, and the kilojoule, 1 kJ = 103 J.

would eliminate the need for a standard reference kilogram and would base all units, including mass, on fundamental

Two widely used units in engineering that are not part of SI, but are acceptable for use
with it, are the bar, a pressure unit equal to 102 kPa, and the liter, a volume unit equal to 103 cm3.
The bar closely approximates atmospheric pressure. Other acceptable units are the minute,
symbol min; hour, symbol h; day, symbol d; and the metric ton, symbol t; equal to 103 kg.
Weight properly refers to the force of gravity on a body, expressed in newtons, and not
to its mass, expressed in kilograms. Force and mass are, of course, directly related through
Newton’s law, with a body’s weight defined as its mass times the local acceleration of gravity.
The comparison of masses by a balance is called “weighing” because it also compares gravitational forces. A spring scale provides correct mass readings only when used in the gravitational field of its calibration.
Although the SI is well established throughout most of the world, use of the U.S.
­Customary system of units persists in daily commerce in the United States. Even in science
and engineering, conversion to SI is incomplete, though globalization is a major incentive.
U.S. Customary units are related to SI units by fixed conversion factors. Those units most
likely to be useful are defined in Appendix A. Conversion factors are listed in Table A.1.

Example 1.1
An astronaut weighs 730 N in Houston, Texas, where the local acceleration of gravity
is g = 9.792 m·s−2. What are the astronaut’s mass and weight on the moon, where
g = 1.67 m·s−2?

Solution 1.1
By Newton’s law, with acceleration equal to the acceleration of gravity, g,

m = __
​ ​= __________
​
​= 74.55​N·m​​−1​·​s​2​​	
g 9.792 ​m·s​​−2​

6

CHAPTER 1. Introduction
Because 1 N = 1 kg·m·s−2,

	​
m = 74.55 kg​	
This mass of the astronaut is independent of location, but weight depends on the
local acceleration of gravity. Thus on the moon the astronaut’s weight is:
	​
F(moon) = m × g(moon) = 74.55 kg × ​1.67 m·s​​−2​​	
or
	​
​F(​ ​moon​)​ = 124.5​kg·m·s​​−2​ = 124.5 N​​	

1.3

MEASURES OF AMOUNT OR SIZE

Three measures of amount or size of a homogeneous material are in common use:
∙ Mass, m    ∙ Number of moles, n    ∙ Total volume, V t
These measures for a specific system are in direct proportion to one another. Mass
may be divided by the molar mass ℳ (formerly called molecular weight) to yield number of
moles:
m
	​
n = ​__​    or    m = ℳn​	
ℳ
Total volume, representing the size of a system, is a defined quantity given as the product of three lengths. It may be divided by the mass or number of moles of the system to yield
specific or molar volume:
​V​t​
∙ Specific volume:	​V ≡ __
​ ​   or   ​V​t​= mV​	
m
​V​t​
∙ Molar volume:	​V ≡ __
​ ​   or   ​V​t​= nV​	
n
Specific or molar density is defined as the reciprocal of specific or molar volume: ρ ≡ V −1.
These quantities (V and ρ) are independent of the size of a system, and are examples
of intensive thermodynamic variables. For a given state of matter (solid, liquid, or gas) they
are functions of temperature, pressure, and composition, additional quantities independent of
system size. Throughout this text, the same symbols will generally be used for both molar and
specific quantities. Most equations of thermodynamics apply to both, and when distinction is
necessary, it can be made based on the context. The alternative of introducing separate notation for each leads to an even greater proliferation of variables than is already inherent in the
study of chemical thermodynamics.

1.4. Temperature

TEMPERATURE

The notion of temperature, based on sensory perception of heat and cold, needs no explanation. It is a matter of common experience. However, giving temperature a scientific role
requires a scale that affixes numbers to the perception of hot and cold. This scale must also
extend far beyond the range of temperatures of everyday experience and perception. Establishing such a scale and devising measuring instruments based on this scale has a long and
intriguing history. A simple instrument is the common liquid-in-glass thermometer, wherein
the liquid expands when heated. Thus a uniform tube, partially filled with mercury, alcohol, or
some other fluid, and connected to a bulb containing a larger amount of fluid, indicates degree
of hotness by the length of the fluid column.
The scale requires definition and the instrument requires calibration. The Celsius4 scale
was established early and remains in common use throughout most of the world. Its scale is
defined by fixing zero as the ice point (freezing point of water saturated with air at standard
atmospheric pressure) and 100 as the steam point (boiling point of pure water at standard
atmospheric pressure). Thus a thermometer when immersed in an ice bath is marked zero and
when immersed in boiling water is marked 100. Dividing the length between these marks into
100 equal spaces, called degrees, provides a scale, which may be extended with equal spaces
below zero and above 100.
Scientific and industrial practice depends on the International Temperature Scale of
1990 (ITS−90).5 This is the Kelvin scale, based on assigned values of temperature for a number of reproducible fixed points, that is, states of pure substances like the ice and steam points,
and on standard instruments calibrated at these temperatures. Interpolation between the fixedpoint temperatures is provided by formulas that establish the relation between readings of
the standard instruments and values on ITS-90. The platinum-resistance thermometer is an
example of a standard instrument; it is used for temperatures from −259.35°C (the triple point
of hydrogen) to 961.78°C (the freezing point of silver).
The Kelvin scale, which we indicate with the symbol T, provides SI temperatures. An
absolute scale, it is based on the concept of a lower limit of temperature, called absolute zero.
Its unit is the kelvin, symbol K. Celsius temperatures, with symbol t, are defined in relation to
Kelvin temperatures:
	​
t° C = T K − 273.15​	
The unit of Celsius temperature is the degree Celsius, °C, which is equal in size to the
kelvin.6 However, temperatures on the Celsius scale are 273.15 degrees lower than on the
Kelvin scale. Thus absolute zero on the Celsius scale occurs at −273.15°C. Kelvin temperatures

It is also available at http://www.its-90.com/its-90.html.

as a unit is not capitalized.

are used in thermodynamic calculations. Celsius temperatures can only be used in thermodynamic calculations involving temperature differences, which are of course the same in both
degrees Celsius and kelvins.

PRESSURE

The primary standard for pressure measurement is the dead-weight gauge in which a known
force is balanced by fluid pressure acting on a piston of known area: P ≡ F/A. The basic design is
shown in Fig. 1.2. Objects of known mass (“weights”) are placed on the pan until the pressure of
the oil, which tends to make the piston rise, is just balanced by the force of gravity on the piston
and all that it supports. With this force given by Newton’s law, the pressure exerted by the oil is:
F mg
	​
P = __
​ ​= ___
​ ​​	
A
A
where m is the mass of the piston, pan, and “weights”; g is the local acceleration of gravity;
and A is the cross-sectional area of the piston. This formula yields gauge pressures, the difference between the pressure of interest and the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere. They
are converted to absolute pressures by addition of the local barometric pressure. Gauges in
common use, such as Bourdon gauges, are calibrated by comparison with dead-weight gauges.
Absolute pressures are used in thermodynamic calculations.

Because a vertical column of fluid under the influence of gravity exerts a pressure at its
base in direct proportion to its height, pressure may be expressed as the equivalent height of a
fluid column. This is the basis for the use of manometers for pressure measurement. Conversion of height to force per unit area follows from Newton’s law applied to the force of gravity

acting on the mass of fluid in the column. The mass is given by: m = Ahρ, where A is the

Thus,
	​

(1.1)

The pressure to which a fluid height corresponds is determined by the density of the fluid
(which depends on its identity and temperature) and the local acceleration of gravity.
A unit of pressure in common use (but not an SI unit) is the standard atmosphere, representing the average pressure exerted by the earth’s atmosphere at sea level, and defined as
101.325 kPa.

Example 1.2
A dead-weight gauge with a piston diameter of 1 cm is used for the accurate measurement of pressure. If a mass of 6.14 kg (including piston and pan) brings it into balance,
and if g = 9.82 m·s−2, what is the gauge pressure being measured? For a barometric
pressure of 0.997 bar, what is the absolute pressure?

Solution 1.2
The force exerted by gravity on the piston, pan, and “weights” is:
	​
F = mg = 6.14 kg × 9.82 ​m·s​​−2​= 60.295 N​	
F

A (​ 1​ ⁄4)​ (​ π)​(​0.01​)​ ​
The absolute pressure is therefore:
	​
P = 7.677 × ​10​​5​+ 0.997 × ​10​​5​= 8.674 × ​10​​5​​N·m​​−2​​	
or
	​
P = 867.4 kPa​	

Example 1.3
At 27°C the reading on a manometer filled with mercury is 60.5 cm. The local
­acceleration of gravity is 9.784 m·s−2. To what pressure does this height of mercury
correspond?

10

CHAPTER 1. Introduction

Solution 1.3
As discussed above, and summarized in Eq. (1.1): P = hρg. At 27°C the density of
mercury is 13.53 g·cm−3. Then,
P = 60.5 cm × 13.53 ​g·cm​​−3​× 9.784 ​m·s​​−2​= 8009 ​g·m·s​​−2​·​cm​​−2​
      
​ ​​​    
​  = 8.009 ​kg·m·s​​−2​·​cm​​−2​= 8.009 ​N·cm​​−2​
 ​​​
​ = 0.8009 × ​10​​5​​N·m​​−2​= 0.8009 bar = 80.09 kPa

1.6

WORK

Work, W, is performed whenever a force acts through a distance. By its definition, the quantity
of work is given by the equation:
	​
dW = F dl​	

(1.2)

where F is the component of force acting along the line of the displacement dl. The SI
unit of work is the newton·meter or joule, symbol J. When integrated, Eq. (1.2) yields the
work of a finite process. By convention, work is regarded as positive when the displacement is in the same direction as the applied force and negative when they are in opposite
directions.
Work is done when pressure acts on a surface and displaces a volume of fluid. An example is the movement of a piston in a cylinder so as to cause compression or expansion of a fluid
contained in the cylinder. The force exerted by the piston on the fluid is equal to the product
of the piston area and the pressure of the fluid. The displacement of the piston is equal to the
total volume change of the fluid divided by the area of the piston. Equation (1.2) therefore
becomes:
​V​t​
	​
dW = −PA d __
​ ​= −P d​V​t​​	
A

(1.3)

Integration yields:
​V​2t ​​ 

	​
W = −​ ​  ​P ​ d​V​t​​	
∫ ​V​1t ​

(1.4)

The minus signs in these equations are made necessary by the sign convention adopted for
work. When the piston moves into the cylinder so as to compress the fluid, the applied force
and its displacement are in the same direction; the work is therefore positive. The minus sign
is required because the volume change is negative. For an expansion process, the applied force
and its displacement are in opposite directions. The volume change in this case is positive, and
the minus sign is again required to make the work negative.

Figure 1.3 shows a path for compression of a gas from point 1, initial volume ​V​1t ​at pressure P1,
to point 2, volume ​V​2t ​at pressure P2. This path relates the pressure at any point of the process
to the volume. The work required is given by Eq. (1.4) and is proportional to the area under
the curve of Fig. 1.3.

1.7

ENERGY

The general principle of conservation of energy was established about 1850. The germ of this
principle as it applies to mechanics was implicit in the work of Galileo (1564–1642) and Isaac
Newton (1642–1726). Indeed, it follows directly from Newton’s second law of motion once
work is defined as the product of force and displacement.

Kinetic Energy
When a body of mass m, acted upon by a force F, is displaced a distance dl during a differential interval of time dt, the work done is given by Eq. (1.2). In combination with Newton’s
second law this equation becomes:
	​
dW = ma dl​	
By definition the acceleration is a ≡ du/dt, where u is the velocity of the body. Thus,
du
dl
	​
dW = m ___
​ ​dl = m __
​ ​du​

Because the definition of velocity is u ≡ dl/dt, this expression for work reduces to:
	​
dW = mu du​	
7However, as explained in Sec. 2.6, there are important limitations on its use.

Each of the quantities _​12 ​m​u​2​in Eq. (1.5) is a kinetic energy, a term introduced by Lord Kelvin8
in 1856. Thus, by definition,

	​
​E​K​≡ __
​ ​m​u​2​​	
2

(1.6)

Equation (1.5) shows that the work done on a body in accelerating it from an initial velocity u1
to a final velocity u2 is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the body. Conversely, if a moving
body is decelerated by the action of a resisting force, the work done by the body is equal to its
change in kinetic energy. With mass in kilograms and velocity in meters/second, kinetic energy
EK is in joules, where 1 J = 1 kg⋅m2⋅s−2 = 1 N⋅m. In accord with Eq. (1.5), this is the unit of work.

Potential Energy
When a body of mass m is raised from an initial elevation z1 to a final elevation z2, an upward
force at least equal to the weight of the body is exerted on it, and this force moves through the
distance z2 − z1. Because the weight of the body is the force of gravity on it, the minimum
force required is given by Newton’s law:
	​
F = ma = mg​	
where g is the local acceleration of gravity. The minimum work required to raise the body is
the product of this force and the change in elevation:
	​
W = F(​z​2​− ​z​1​) = mg(​z​2​− ​z​1​)​	
or
	​
W = m​z​2​g − m​z​1​g = mgΔz​	

(1.7)

We see from Eq. (1.7) that work done on a body in raising it is equal to the change in the quantity mzg. Conversely, if a body is lowered against a resisting force equal to its weight, the work
done by the body is equal to the change in the quantity mzg. Each of the quantities mzg in
Eq. (1.7) is a potential energy.9 Thus, by definition,
	​
​E​P​= mzg​

1.7. Energy

With mass in kg, elevation in m, and the acceleration of gravity in m·s−2, EP is in joules,
where 1 J = 1 kg⋅m2⋅s−2 = 1 N⋅m. In accord with Eq. (1.7), this is the unit of work.

Energy Conservation
The utility of the energy-conservation principle was alluded to in Sec. 1.1. The definitions of
kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the preceding section provide for limited
quantitative applications. Equation (1.5) shows that the work done on an accelerating body
produces a change in its kinetic energy:
m​u​2​
	​
W = Δ​E​K​= Δ​​ _
​
​ ​​	
( 2 )
Similarly, Eq. (1.7) shows that the work done on a body in elevating it produces a change
in its potential energy:
	​
W = ​E​P​= Δ​​(​mzg​)​​	
One simple consequence of these definitions is that an elevated body, allowed to fall
freely (i.e., without friction or other resistance), gains in kinetic energy what it loses in potential energy. Mathematically,
	​
Δ​E​K​+ Δ​E​P​= 0​	
or
m​u​  22​​  ____
m​u​  21​​ 
	​​ ____
 ​− ​   ​
+ m​z​2​g − m​z​1​g = 0​	
2
2
The validity of this equation has been confirmed by countless experiments. Thus the development of the concept of energy led logically to the principle of its conservation for all purely
mechanical processes, that is, processes without friction or heat transfer.
Other forms of mechanical energy are recognized. Among the most obvious is potential
energy of configuration. When a spring is compressed, work is done by an external force.
Because the spring can later perform this work against a resisting force, it possesses potential
energy of configuration. Energy of the same form exists in a stretched rubber band or in a bar
of metal deformed in the elastic region.
The generality of the principle of conservation of energy in mechanics is increased if we
look upon work itself as a form of energy. This is clearly permissible because both kinetic- and
potential-energy changes are equal to the work done in producing them [Eqs. (1.5) and (1.7)].
However, work is energy in transit and is never regarded as residing in a body. When work is done
and does not appear simultaneously as work elsewhere, it is converted into another form of energy.
With the body or assemblage on which attention is focused as the system and all else as
the surroundings, work represents energy transferred from the surroundings to the system, or the
reverse. It is only during this transfer that the form of energy known as work exists. In contrast,
kinetic and potential energy reside with the system. Their values, however, are measured with
reference to the surroundings; that is, kinetic energy depends on velocity with respect to the
surroundings, and potential energy depends on elevation with respect to a datum level. Changes in
kinetic and potential energy do not depend on these reference conditions, provided they are fixed.

CHAPTER 1. Introduction

Example 1.4
An elevator with a mass of 2500 kg rests at a level 10 m above the base of an elevator shaft. It is raised to 100 m above the base of the shaft, where the cable holding
it breaks. The elevator falls freely to the base of the shaft and strikes a strong spring.
The spring is designed to bring the elevator to rest and, by means of a catch arrangement, to hold the elevator at the position of maximum spring compression. Assuming
the entire process to be frictionless, and taking g = 9.8 m⋅s−2, calculate:
(a) The potential energy of the elevator in its initial position relative to its base.
(b) The work done in raising the elevator.
(c) The potential energy of the elevator in its highest position.
(d) The velocity and kinetic energy of the elevator just before it strikes the spring.
(e) The potential energy of the compressed spring.
(f) The energy of the system consisting of the elevator and spring (1) at the start
of the process, (2) when the elevator reaches its maximum height, (3) just
before the elevator strikes the spring, (4) after the elevator has come to rest.

Solution 1.4
Let subscript 1 denote the initial state; subscript 2, the state when the elevator is at
its greatest elevation; and subscript 3, the state just before the elevator strikes the
spring, as indicated in the figure.

(b) Work is computed by Eq. (1.7). Units are as in the preceding calculation:
​W = mg​(​z​2​− ​z​1)​ ​= (​ ​2500​)(​ ​9.8​)​(​100 − 10​)​
	​
​
   ​​	
     = 2,205,000 J
(c) Again by Eq. (1.8),
	​
​E​​P​2​​ = m​z​2​g = ​(​2500​)​(​100​)​(​9.8​)​= 2,450,000 J​​	
Note that W​ ​=​​E​​P​2​​​ ​−
​ ​  ​E​​P​1​​.​
(d) The sum of the kinetic- and potential-energy changes during the process from
state 2 to state 3 is zero; that is,
	​
​Δ​E​​K​2→3​​+ Δ​E​​P​2→3​​= 0​

or ​ ​E​​K​3​​− ​E​​K​2​​+ ​E​​P​3​​− ​E​​P​2​​= 0​​	

However, ​E​​K​2​​ and ​E​​P​3​​ are zero; hence ​E​​K​3​​ = ​E​​P​2​​ = 2,450,000 J.

(e) The changes in the potential energy of the spring and the kinetic energy of the
elevator must sum to zero:
	​
​Δ​E​P ​(​spring​)​+ Δ​E​K​(​elevator​)​= 0​​	
The initial potential energy of the spring and the final kinetic energy of the elevator are zero; therefore, the final potential energy of the spring equals the kinetic
energy of the elevator just before it strikes the spring. Thus the final potential
energy of the spring is 2,450,000 J.
( f ) With the elevator and spring as the system, the initial energy is the potential energy of the elevator, or 245,000 J. The only energy change of the system
occurs when work is done in raising the elevator. This amounts to 2,205,000 J,
and the energy of the system when the elevator is at maximum height is 245,000 +
2,205,000 = 2,450,000 J. Subsequent changes occur entirely within the system,
without interaction with the surroundings, and the total energy of the system
remains constant at 2,450,000 J. It merely changes from potential energy of position (elevation) of the elevator to kinetic energy of the elevator to potential energy
of configuration of the spring.
This example illustrates the conservation of mechanical energy. However, the
entire process is assumed to occur without friction, and the results obtained are
exact only for such an idealized process.

CHAPTER 1. Introduction

Example 1.5
A team from Engineers Without Borders constructs a system to supply water to a
mountainside village located 1800 m above sea level from a spring in the valley below
at 1500 m above sea level.
(a) When the pipe from the spring to the village is full of water, but no water is flowing, what is the pressure difference between the end of the pipe at the spring
and the end of the pipe in the village?
(b) What is the change in gravitational potential energy of a liter of water when it is
pumped from the spring to the village?
(c) What is the minimum amount of work required to pump a liter of water from the
spring to the village?

Solution 1.5
(a) Take the density of water as 1000 kg⋅m−3 and the acceleration of gravity as
9.8 m⋅s−2. By Eq. (1.1):
	​
P = hρg = 300 m × 1000 ​kg·m​​−3​× 9.8 ​m·s​​−2​= 29.4 × ​10​​5​​kg·m​​−1​⋅​s​−2​​	
Whence ​
​P = 29.4 bar​ or​ 2940 kPa​​	
(b) The mass of a liter of water is approximately 1 kg, and its potential-energy

Δ​E​P​= Δ(mzg) = mgΔz = 1 kg × 9.8 ​m·s​​−2​× 300 m = 2940 N·m = 2940 J​	
(c) The minimum amount of work required to lift each liter of water through an
elevation change of 300 m equals the potential-energy change of the water. It is
a minimum value because it takes no account of fluid friction that results from
finite-velocity pipe flow.

HEAT

At the time when the principle of conservation of mechanical energy emerged, heat was
considered an indestructible fluid called caloric. This concept was firmly entrenched, and
it limited the application of energy conservation to frictionless mechanical processes. Such
a limitation is now long gone. Heat, like work, is recognized as energy in transit. A simple
example is the braking of an automobile. When its speed is reduced by the application of
brakes, heat generated by friction is transferred to the surroundings in an amount equal to the
change in kinetic energy of the vehicle.10
10Many modern electric or hybrid cars employ regenerative braking, a process through which some of the kinetic
energy of the vehicle is converted to electrical energy and stored in a battery or capacitor for later use, rather than
simply being transferred to the surroundings as heat.

1.9. Synopsis

We know from experience that a hot object brought into contact with a cold object
becomes cooler, whereas the cold object becomes warmer. A reasonable view is that something is transferred from the hot object to the cold one, and we call that something heat Q.11
Thus we say that heat always flows from a higher temperature to a lower one. This leads to the
concept of temperature as the driving force for the transfer of energy as heat. When no temperature difference exists, no spontaneous heat transfer occurs, a condition of thermal equilibrium. In the thermodynamic sense, heat is never regarded as being stored within a body. Like
work, it exists only as energy in transit from one body to another; in thermodynamics, from
system to surroundings. When energy in the form of heat is added to a system, it is stored not
as heat but as kinetic and potential energy of the atoms and molecules making up the system.
A kitchen refrigerator running on electrical energy must transfer this energy to the
surroundings as heat. This may seem counterintuitive, as the interior of the refrigerator is
maintained at temperatures below that of the surroundings, resulting in heat transfer into the
refrigerator. But hidden from view (usually) is a heat exchanger that transfers heat to the surroundings in an amount equal to the sum of the electrical energy supplied to the refrigerator
and the heat transfer into the refrigerator. Thus the net result is heating of the kitchen. A room
air conditioner, operating in the same way, extracts heat from the room, but the heat exchanger
is external, exhausting heat to the outside air, thus cooling the room.
In spite of the transient nature of heat, it is often viewed in relation to its effect on the
system from which or to which it is transferred. Until about 1930 the definitions of units of
heat were based on temperature changes of a unit mass of water. Thus the calorie was defined
as that quantity of heat which, when transferred to one gram of water, raised its temperature
one degree Celsius.12 With heat now understood to be a form of energy, its SI unit is the joule.
The SI unit of power is the watt, symbol W, defined as an energy rate of one joule per second.
The tables of Appendix A provide relevant conversion factors.

SYNOPSIS

After studying this chapter, including the end-of-chapter problems, one should be able to:
∙ Describe qualitatively the scope and structure of thermodynamics
∙ Solve problems involving the pressure exerted by a column of fluid
∙ Solve problems involving conservation of mechanical energy
∙ Use SI units and convert from U.S. Customary to SI units
∙ Apply the concept of work as the transfer of energy accompanying the action of a force
through a distance, and by extension to the action of pressure (force per area) acting

hot one.

measure the energy content of food is 1000 times larger.

The First Law and Other
Basic Concepts

In this chapter, we introduce and apply the first law of thermodynamics, one of the two fundamental laws upon which all of thermodynamics rests. Thus, in this chapter we:
∙ Introduce the concept of internal energy; i.e., energy stored within a substance
∙ Present the first law of thermodynamics, which reflects the observation that energy is
neither created nor destroyed
∙ Develop the concepts of thermodynamic equilibrium, state functions, and the thermodynamic state of a system
∙ Develop the concept of reversible processes connecting equilibrium states
∙ Introduce enthalpy, another measure of energy stored within a substance, particularly
useful in analyzing open systems
∙ Use heat capacities to relate changes in the internal energy and enthalpy of a substance
to changes in its temperature
∙ Illustrate the construction of energy balances for open systems

2.1

JOULE’S EXPERIMENTS

The present-day concept of heat developed following crucial experiments carried out in the
1840s by James P. Joule.1 In the most famous series of measurements, he placed known amounts
of water, oil, or mercury in an insulated container and agitated the fluid with a rotating stirrer.
The amounts of work done on the fluid by the stirrer and the resulting temperature changes of the
fluid were accurately and precisely measured. Joule showed that for each fluid a fixed amount
of work per unit mass was required for each degree of temperature rise caused by the stirring,
and that the original temperature of the fluid was restored by the transfer of heat through simple

2.3. The First Law of Thermodynamics

25

contact with a cooler object. These experiments demonstrated the existence of a quantitative
relationship between work and heat, and thereby showed that heat is a form of energy.

2.2

INTERNAL ENERGY

In experiments like those of Joule, energy added to a fluid as work is later transferred from the
fluid as heat. Where does this energy reside after its addition to, and before its transfer from,
the fluid? A rational answer to this question is that it is contained within the fluid in another
form, which we call internal energy.
The internal energy of a substance does not include energy that it may possess as a
result of its gross position or movement as a whole. Rather it refers to energy of the molecules
comprising the substance. Because of their ceaseless motion, all molecules possess kinetic
energy of translation (motion through space); except for monatomic substances, they also possess kinetic energy of rotation and of internal vibration. The addition of heat to a substance
increases molecular motion, and thus causes an increase in the internal energy of the substance.
Work done on the substance can have the same effect, as was shown by Joule. The internal
energy of a substance also includes the potential energy associated with intermolecular forces.
Molecules attract or repel one another, and potential energy is stored through these interactions, just as potential energy of configuration is stored in a compressed or stretched spring.
On a submolecular scale, energy is associated with the interactions of electrons and nuclei of
atoms, which includes the energy of chemical bonds that hold atoms together as molecules.
This energy is named internal to distinguish it from the kinetic and potential energy
associated with a substance because of its macroscopic position, configuration, or motion,
which can be thought of as external forms of energy.
Internal energy has no concise thermodynamic definition. It is a thermodynamic primitive. It cannot be directly measured; there are no internal-energy meters. As a result, absolute
values are unknown. However, this is not a disadvantage in thermodynamic analysis because
only changes in internal energy are required. In the context of classical thermodynamics, the
details of how internal energy is stored are immaterial. This is the province of statistical thermodynamics, which treats the relationship of macroscopic properties such as internal energy
to molecular motions and interactions.

2.3

THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

Recognition of heat and internal energy as forms of energy makes possible the generalization
of the principle of conservation of mechanical energy (Sec. 1.7) to include heat and internal
energy in addition to work and external potential and kinetic energy. Indeed, the generalization
can be extended to still other forms, such as surface energy, electrical energy, and magnetic
energy. Overwhelming evidence of the validity of this generalization has raised its stature to
that of a law of nature, known as the first law of thermodynamics. One formal statement is:
Although energy assumes many forms, the total quantity of energy is constant, and when energy disappears in one form it appears s­ imultaneously
in other forms.

26

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

In application of this law to a given process, the sphere of influence of the process
is divided into two parts, the system and its surroundings. The region in which the process
occurs is set apart as the system; everything with which the system interacts is its surroundings. A system may be of any size; its boundaries may be real or imaginary, rigid or flexible.
Frequently a system consists of a single substance; in other cases it may be complex. In any
event, the equations of thermodynamics are written with reference to a well-defined system.
This focuses attention on the particular process of interest and on the equipment and material
directly involved in the process. However, the first law applies to the system and its surroundings; not to the system alone. For any process, the first law requires:
	​
​Δ​(​Energy of the system​)​+ Δ​(​Energy of surroundings​)​= 0​​	

(2.1)

where the difference operator “Δ” signifies finite changes in the quantities enclosed in parentheses. The system may change in its internal energy, in its potential or kinetic energy, and in
the potential or kinetic energy of its finite parts.
In the context of thermodynamics, heat and work represent energy in transit across
the boundary dividing the system from its surroundings, and are never stored or contained
in the system. Potential, kinetic, and internal energy, on the other hand, reside with and are
stored with matter. Heat and work represent energy flows to or from a system, while potential,
kinetic, and internal energy represent quantities of energy associated with a system. In practice
Eq. (2.1) assumes special forms suitable to specific applications. The development of these
forms and their subsequent application are the subject of the remainder of this chapter.

2.4

ENERGY BALANCE FOR CLOSED SYSTEMS

If the boundary of a system does not permit the transfer of matter between the system and its
surroundings, the system is said to be closed, and its mass is necessarily constant. The development of basic concepts in thermodynamics is facilitated by a careful examination of closed
systems. For this reason they are treated in detail here. Far more important for industrial practice are processes in which matter crosses the system boundary as streams that enter and leave
process equipment. Such systems are said to be open, and they are treated later in this chapter,
once the necessary foundation material has been presented.
Because no streams enter or leave a closed system, no energy associated with matter
is transported across the boundary that divides the system from its surroundings. All energy
exchange between a closed system and its surroundings is in the form of heat or work, and the
total energy change of the surroundings equals the net energy transferred to or from it as heat
and work. The second term of Eq. (2.1) may therefore be replaced by variables representing
heat and work, to yield
	​
Δ(Energy of surroundings) = ±Q ± W​	
Heat Q and work W always refer to the system, and the choice of sign for numerical values of
these quantities depends on which direction of energy transfer with respect to the system is
regarded as positive. We adopt the convention that makes the numerical values of both quantities positive for transfer into the system from the surroundings. The corresponding quantities

27

2.4. Energy Balance for Closed Systems

taken with reference to the surroundings, Qsurr and Wsurr, have the opposite sign, i.e., Qsurr = −Q
and Wsurr = −W. With this understanding:
	​
Δ(Energy of surroundings) = ​Qsurr
​ ​+ ​Wsurr
​ ​= − Q − W​	
Equation (2.1) now becomes:2
	​
​Δ​(​Energy of the system​)​= Q + W​​	

(2.2)

This equation states that the total energy change of a closed system equals the net energy
transferred into it as heat and work.
Closed systems often undergo processes during which only the internal energy of the
system changes. For such processes, Eq. (2.2) reduces to:
	​
​Δ​U​t​= Q + W​​	

(2.3)

where Ut is the total internal energy of the system. Equation (2.3) applies to processes of finite
change in the internal energy of the system. For differential changes in Ut:
	​
​d​U​t​= dQ + dW​​	

(2.4)

In Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) the symbols Q, W, and Ut pertain to the entire system, which may be of
any size, but must be clearly defined. All terms require expression in the same energy units. In
the SI system the unit is the joule.
Total volume Vt and total internal energy Ut depend on the quantity of material in a
system, and are called extensive properties. In contrast, temperature and pressure, the principal
thermodynamic coordinates for pure homogeneous fluids, are independent of the quantity of
material, and are known as intensive properties. For a homogeneous system, an alternative
means of expression for the extensive properties, such as Vt and Ut, is:
	​
​V​t​= mV or V
​ ​t​= nV  and   ​U​t​= mU or

​ ​t​= nU​	
U

where the plain symbols V and U represent the volume and internal energy of a unit amount of
material, either a unit mass or a mole. These are specific or molar properties, respectively, and
they are intensive, independent of the quantity of material actually present.
Although V t and Ut for a homogeneous system of arbitrary size are
extensive properties, specific and molar volume V and specific and molar
internal energy U are intensive.
Note that the intensive coordinates T and P have no extensive counterparts.
For a closed system of n moles, Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) may now be written:
	​
​Δ(nU ) = n ΔU = Q + W​​​​

(2.5)

	​
​d(nU ) = n dU = dQ + dW​​	

(2.6)

2The sign convention used here is recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. However, the original choice of sign for work and the one used in the first four editions of this text was the opposite, and
the right side of Eq. (2.2) was then written Q − W.

28

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

In this form, these equations show explicitly the amount of substance comprising the system.
The equations of thermodynamics are often written for a representative unit amount of
material, either a unit mass or a mole. Thus, for n = 1, Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) become:
	​
ΔU = Q + W   and   dU = dQ + dW​	
The basis for Q and W is always implied by the mass or number of moles associated with the
left side of the energy equation.
These equations do not provide a definition of internal energy. Indeed, they presume
prior affirmation of the existence of internal energy, as expressed in the following axiom:
Axiom 1: There exists a form of energy, known as internal energy U, which
is an intrinsic property of a system, functionally related to the measurable
coordinates that characterize the system. For a closed system, not in
motion, changes in this property are given by Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6).
Equations (2.5) and (2.6) not only supply the means for calculation of changes in
i­nternal energy from experimental measurements, but they also enable us to derive further
property relations that supply connections to readily measurable characteristics (e.g., temperature and pressure). Moreover, they have a dual purpose, because once internal-energy values
are known, they provide for the calculation of heat and work quantities for practical processes.
Having accepted the preceding axiom and associated definitions of a system and its surroundings, one may state the first law of thermodynamics concisely as a second axiom:
Axiom 2: (The First Law of Thermodynamics) The total energy of any
­system and its surroundings is conserved.
These two axioms cannot be proven, nor can they be expressed in a simpler way. When
changes in internal energy are computed in accord with Axiom 1, then Axiom 2 is universally
observed to be true. The profound importance of these axioms is that they are the basis for
formulation of energy balances applicable to a vast number of processes. Without exception,
they predict the behavior of real systems.3

Example 2.1
The Niagara river, separating the United States from Canada, flows from Lake Erie
to Lake Ontario. These lakes differ in elevation by about 100 m. Most of this drop
occurs over Niagara Falls and in the rapids just above and below the falls, creating
a natural opportunity for hydroelectric power generation. The Robert Moses hydroelectric power plant draws water from the river well above the falls and discharges it
well below them. It has a peak capacity of 2,300,000 kW at a maximum water flow of
3,100,000 kg·s−1. In the following, take 1 kg of water as the system.

(a) What is the potential energy of the water flowing out of Lake Erie, relative to
the surface of Lake Ontario?
(b) At peak capacity, what fraction of this potential energy is converted to electrical energy in the Robert Moses power plant?
(c) If the temperature of the water is unchanged in the overall process, how much
heat flows to or from it?

Solution 2.1
(a) Gravitational potential energy is related to height by Eq. (1.8). With g equal to its
standard value, this equation yields:
​E​P​= mzg = 1 kg × 100 m × 9.81 m⋅ ​s​−2​
	​
​    
​
​
​​	
​
= 981 kg⋅​m​2​⋅s​​−2​= 981 N⋅m = 981 J
(b) Recalling that 1 kW = 1000 J⋅s−1, we find the electrical energy generated per kg
water is:
2.3 × ​10​​6​ kW
_____________
	​
​  
  
​ = 0.742 kW⋅s⋅​kg​​−1​= 742 J⋅​kg​​−1​​	
3.1 × ​10​​6​ kg⋅​s​−1​
The fraction of the potential energy converted to electrical energy is 742/981 = 0.76.
This conversion efficiency would be higher but for the dissipation of potential
energy in the flow upstream and downstream of the power plant.
(c) If the water leaves the process at the same temperature at which it enters, then its
internal energy is unchanged. Neglecting also any change in kinetic energy, we
write the first law, in the form of Eq. (2.2), as
	​
​Δ​(​Energy of the system​)​= Δ​Ep​ ​= Q + W​​	
For each kilogram of water, W = −742 J and ΔEP = −981 J. Then
	​
Q = Δ​Ep​ ​− W = − 981 + 742 = − 239 J​	
This is heat lost from the system.

Example 2.2
A typical industrial-scale wind turbine has a peak efficiency of about 0.44 for a wind
speed of 9 m·s−1. That is, it converts about 44% of the kinetic energy of the wind
approaching it into usable electrical energy. The total air flow impinging on such a
turbine with a rotor diameter of 43 m is about 15,000 kg·s−1 for the given wind speed.

30

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts
(a) How much electrical energy is produced when 1 kg of air passes through the
turbine?
(b) What is the power output of the turbine?
(c) If there is no heat transferred to the air, and if its temperature remains
unchanged, what is its change in speed upon passing through the turbine?

Solution 2.2
(a) The kinetic energy of the wind on the basis of 1 kg of air is:
1
(1 kg) ​(9 ​m·s​​−1​)​2​
​E​​K​1​​ = __
​ ​m​u​2​= _____________
​   ​= 40.5 kg·​m​2​·s​​−2​= 40.5 J​
2
2
Thus, the electrical energy produced per kilogram of air is 0.44 × 40.5 = 17.8 J.
(b) The power output is:
	​
17.8 ​J·kg​​−1​× 15,000 kg·​s​−1​= 267,000 ​J·s​​−1​= 267 kW​	
(c) If the temperature and pressure of the air are unchanged, then its internal energy is
unchanged. Changes in gravitational potential energy can also be neglected. Thus,
with no heat transfer, the first law becomes
	​
Δ(Energy of the system) = Δ​E​K​= ​E​​K​2​​ − ​E​​K​1​​ = W = −17.8 J⋅​kg​​−1​
	​
​E​​K​2​​= 40.5 − 17.8 = 22.7 J⋅​kg​​−1​= 22.7 N⋅m⋅​kg​​−1​= 22.7 ​m​2​⋅s​​−2​
​u​2​ ​
	​
​E​​K​2​​ = __
​  2 ​ = 22.7 ​m​2​⋅s​​−2​  and   ​u​2​= 6.74 m​⋅s​​−1​
2
The decrease in air speed is: 9.00 − 6.74 = 2.26 m·s−1.

2.5

EQUILIBRIUM AND THE THERMODYNAMIC STATE

Equilibrium is a word denoting a static condition, the absence of change. In thermodynamics
it means not only the absence of change but the absence of any tendency toward change on a
macroscopic scale. Because any tendency toward change is caused by a driving force of one
kind or another, the absence of such a tendency indicates also the absence of any driving force.
Hence, for a system at equilibrium all forces are in exact balance.
Different kinds of driving forces tend to bring about different kinds of change. For example, imbalance of mechanical forces such as pressure on a piston tend to cause energy transfer as work; temperature differences tend to cause the flow of heat; differences in ­chemical
­potential4 tend to cause substances to be transferred from one phase to another. At equilibrium
all such forces are in balance.
4Chemical potential is a thermodynamic property treated in Chapter 10.

2.5. Equilibrium and the Thermodynamic State

31

Whether a change actually occurs in a system not at equilibrium depends on resistance
as well as on driving force. Systems subject to appreciable driving forces may change at a
negligible rate if the resistance to change is very large. For example, a mixture of hydrogen
and oxygen at ordinary conditions is not in chemical equilibrium, because of the large driving
force for the formation of water. However, if chemical reaction is not initiated, this system may
exist in long-term thermal and mechanical equilibrium, and purely physical processes may be
analyzed without regard to possible chemical reaction.
Likewise, living organisms are inherently far from overall thermodynamic equilibrium.
They are constantly undergoing dynamic changes governed by the rates of competing biochemical reactions, which are outside the scope of thermodynamic analysis. Nonetheless,
many local equilibria within organisms are amenable to thermodynamic analysis. Examples
include the denaturing (unfolding) of proteins and the binding of enzymes to their substrates.
The systems most commonly found in chemical technology are fluids, for which the
primary characteristics (properties) are temperature T, pressure P, specific or molar volume V,
and composition. Such systems are known as PVT systems. They exist at internal equilibrium
when their properties are uniform throughout the system, and conform to the following axiom:
Axiom 3: The macroscopic properties of a homogeneous PVT system at
internal equilibrium can be expressed as a function of its temperature,
pressure, and composition.
This axiom prescribes an idealization, a model that excludes the influence of fields (e.g.,
electric, magnetic, and gravitational) as well as surface effects and other less common effects.
It is entirely satisfactory in a multitude of practical applications.
Associated with the concept of internal equilibrium is the concept of thermodynamic
state for which a PVT system has a set of identifiable and reproducible properties, including
not only P, V, and T, but also internal energy. However, the notation of Eqs. (2.3) through
(2.6) suggests that the internal energy terms on the left are different in kind from the quantities
on the right. Those on the left reflect changes in the thermodynamic state of the system as
reflected by its properties. For a homogeneous pure substance we know from experience that
fixing two of these properties also fixes all the others, and thus determines its thermodynamic
state. For example, nitrogen gas at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 105 Pa (1 bar)
has a fixed specific volume or density and a fixed molar internal energy. Indeed, it has a complete set of intensive thermodynamic properties. If this gas is heated or cooled, compressed or
expanded, and then returned to its initial temperature and pressure, its intensive properties are
restored to their initial values. They do not depend on the past history of the substance nor on
the means by which it reaches a given state. They depend only on present conditions, however
reached. Such quantities are known as state functions. For a homogeneous pure substance, if
two state functions are held at fixed values the thermodynamic state of the substance is fully
determined.5 This means that a state function, such as specific internal energy, is a property
that always has a value; it may therefore be expressed mathematically as a function of such
coordinates as temperature and pressure, or temperature and density, and its values may be
identified with points on a graph.

5For systems of greater complexity, the number of state functions that must be specified in order to define the state
of the system may be different from two. The method of determining this number is found in Sec. 3.1.

32

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

On the other hand, the terms on the right sides of Eqs. (2.3) through (2.6), representing
heat and work quantities, are not properties; they account for the energy changes that occur in the
surroundings. They depend on the nature of the process, and they may be associated with areas
rather than points on a graph, as suggested by Fig. 1.3. Although time is not a thermodynamic
coordinate, the passage of time is inevitable whenever heat is transferred or work is accomplished.
The differential of a state function represents an infinitesimal change in its value. Integration of such a differential results in a finite difference between two of its values, e.g.:
	​​

V2

U2

​  ​dV  ​​​= ​V​2​− ​V​1​= ΔV   and   ​ ​  ​dU ​ = ​U​2​− ​U​1​= ΔU​	
∫ V1
∫ U1

The differentials of heat and work are not changes, but are infinitesimal amounts. When integrated, these differentials give not finite changes, but finite amounts. Thus,
	​
dQ = Q   and    dW = W​	
∫
∫
For a closed system undergoing the same change in state by several processes, experiment shows that the amounts of heat and work required
differ for different processes, but that the sum Q + W [Eqs. (2.3) and
(2.5)] is the same for all processes.
This is the basis for the identification of internal energy as a state function. The same
value of Δ​​U​​  t​​is given by Eq. (2.3) regardless of the process, provided only that the change in
the system is between the same initial and final states.

Example 2.3
A gas is confined in a cylinder by a piston. The initial pressure of the gas is 7 bar, and
the volume is 0.10 m3. The piston is held in place by latches.
(a) The whole apparatus is placed in a total vacuum. What is the energy change of
the apparatus if the restraining latches are removed so that the gas suddenly
expands to double its initial volume, the piston striking other latches at the end
of the process?
(b) The process described in (a) is repeated, but in air at 101.3 kPa, rather than
in a vacuum. What is the energy change of the apparatus? Assume the rate of
heat exchange between the apparatus and the surrounding air is slow compared with the rate at which the process occurs.

Solution 2.3
Because the question concerns the entire apparatus, the system is taken as the gas, piston,
and cylinder.

(a) No work is done during the process, because no force external to the system moves,
and no heat is transferred through the vacuum surrounding the apparatus. Hence Q
and W are zero, and the total energy of the system does not change. Without further
information we can say nothing about the distribution of energy among the parts of
the system. This may be different than the initial distribution.
(b) Here, work is done by the system in pushing back the atmosphere. It is evaluated
as the product of the force of atmospheric pressure on the back side of the piston,
F = Patm A, and the displacement of the piston, Δl = ΔV t/A, where A is the area of
the piston and ΔV t is the volume change of the gas. This is work done by the system
on the surroundings, and is a negative quantity; thus,
kN
	​
W = − F Δl = − ​Patm
​ ​Δ​V​t​= − (101.3) (0.2 − 0.1) kPa⋅​m​3​= − 10.13 ___
​ 2 ​​⋅m​​3​​	
​m​ ​
or
	​
W = −10.13 kN·m = −10.13 kJ​	
Heat transfer between the system and surroundings is also possible in this case,
but the problem is worked for the instant after the process has occurred and before
appreciable heat transfer has had time to take place. Thus Q is assumed to be zero
in Eq. (2.2), giving:
	​
Δ(Energy of the system) = Q + W = 0 − 10.13 = −10.13 kJ​	
The total energy of the system has decreased by an amount equal to the work done
on the surroundings.

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

Example 2.4
When a system is taken from state a to state b in the accompanying figure along path
acb, 100 J of heat flows into the system and the system does 40 J of work.
(a) How much heat flows into the system along path aeb if the work done by the

(b) The system returns from b to a along path bda. If the work done on the system

	​
Δ​U​ab
​= ​Q​acb​+ ​W​acb​= 100 − 40 = 60 J​	

(a) For path aeb,

	​
Δ​U​ab

​Q​bda​ = − 60 − 30 = − 90 J​	
Heat is therefore transferred from the system to the surroundings.

2.6. The Reversible Process

35

THE REVERSIBLE PROCESS

The development of thermodynamics is facilitated by the introduction of a special kind of
closed-system process characterized as reversible:
A process is reversible when its direction can be reversed at any point by
an infinitesimal change in external conditions.
The reversible process is ideal in that it produces a best possible result; it yields the minimum work input required or maximum work output attainable from a specified process. It
represents a limit to the performance of an actual process that is never fully realized. Work is
often calculated for hypothetical reversible processes, because the choice is between this calculation and no calculation at all. The reversible work as the limiting value may then be combined with an appropriate efficiency to yield a reasonable approximation to the work required
for or produced by an actual process.6
The concept of the reversible processes also plays a key role in the derivation of thermodynamic relationships. In this context, we often compute changes in thermodynamic state
functions along the path of a hypothetical reversible process. If the result is a relationship
involving only state functions, then this relationship is valid for any process that results in the
same change of state. Indeed, the primary use of the reversible process concept is for derivation of generally valid relationships among state functions.

Reversible Expansion of a Gas
The piston in Fig. 2.1 confines gas at a pressure just sufficient to balance the weight of the piston and all that it supports. In this equilibrium condition the system has no tendency to change.
Imagine that mass m is slid from the piston to a shelf (at the same level). The piston assembly
accelerates upward, reaching maximum velocity when the upward force on the piston just
balances its weight. Momentum then carries it to a higher level, where it reverses direction.
If the piston were held in the position of maximum elevation, its potential-energy increase
would very nearly equal the expansion work done by the gas. However, when unconstrained,
the piston assembly oscillates, with decreasing amplitude, ultimately coming to rest at a new
equilibrium position Δl above the old.
Oscillations are damped out because the viscous nature of the gas gradually converts
gross directed motion of the molecules into chaotic molecular motion. This dissipative process
transforms some of the work done by the gas in raising the piston into internal energy of the
gas. Once the process is initiated, no infinitesimal change in external conditions can reverse it;
the process is irreversible.
The dissipative effects of the process have their origin in the sudden removal of a finite
mass from the piston. The resulting imbalance of forces acting on the piston causes its acceleration and leads to its subsequent oscillation. The sudden removal of smaller mass increments
reduces, but does not eliminate, this dissipative effect. Even the removal of an infinitesimal
mass leads to piston oscillations of infinitesimal amplitude and a consequent dissipative effect.
However, one may imagine a process wherein small mass increments are removed one after
6Quantitative analysis of the relationships between efficiency and irreversibility requires use of the second law of
thermodynamics, and is treated in Chapter 5.

36

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

Figure 2.1: Expansion of a gas. The nature of reversible
processes is illustrated by the expansion of gas in an
idealized piston/cylinder arrangement. The apparatus shown
is imagined to exist in an evacuated space. The gas trapped
inside the cylinder is chosen as the system; all else is the
surroundings. Expansion results when mass is removed
from the piston. For simplicity, assume that the piston slides
within the cylinder without friction and that the piston and
cylinder neither absorb nor transmit heat. Moreover, because
the density of the gas in the cylinder is low and its mass is
small, we ignore the effects of gravity on the contents of the
cylinder. This means that gravity-induced pressure gradients
in the gas are very small relative to its total pressure and
that changes in potential energy of the gas are negligible in
comparison with the potential-energy changes of the piston
assembly.

another at a rate such that the piston’s rise is continuous, with minute oscillation only at the
end of the process.
The limiting case of removal of a succession of infinitesimal masses from the piston is
approximated when the masses m in Fig. 2.1 are replaced by a pile of powder, blown in a very
fine stream from the piston. During this process, the piston rises at a uniform but very slow
rate, and the powder collects in storage at ever higher levels. The system is never more than
differentially displaced from internal equilibrium or from equilibrium with its surroundings.
If the removal of powder from the piston is stopped and the direction of transfer of powder is
reversed, the process reverses direction and proceeds backwards along its original path. Both
the system and its surroundings are ultimately restored to virtually their initial conditions. The
original process approaches reversibility.
Without the assumption of a frictionless piston, we cannot imagine a reversible process.
If the piston sticks, a finite mass must be removed before the piston breaks free. Thus the
equilibrium condition necessary to reversibility is not maintained. Moreover, friction between
two sliding parts is a mechanism for the dissipation of mechanical energy into internal energy.
This discussion has centered on a single closed-system process, the expansion of a gas
in a cylinder. The opposite process, compression of a gas in a cylinder, is described in exactly
the same way. There are, however, many processes that are driven by an imbalance of other
than mechanical forces. For example, heat flow occurs when a temperature difference exists,
electricity flows under the influence of an electromotive force, and chemical reactions occur
in response to driving forces that arise from differences in the strengths and configurations
of chemical bonds in molecules. The driving forces for chemical reactions and for transfer of
substances between phases are complex functions of temperature, pressure, and composition,
as will be described in detail in later chapters. In general, a process is reversible when the net

37

2.6. The Reversible Process

force driving it is infinitesimal in size. Thus heat is transferred reversibly when it flows from a
finite object at temperature T to another such object at temperature T − dT.

Reversible Chemical Reaction
The concept of a reversible chemical reaction is illustrated by the decomposition of solid
calcium carbonate to form solid calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas. At equilibrium, this
system exerts a specific decomposition pressure of CO2 for a given temperature. The chemical reaction is held in balance (in equilibrium) by the pressure of the CO2. Any change of
conditions, however slight, upsets the equilibrium and causes the reaction to proceed in one
direction or the other.
If the mass m in Fig. 2.2 is minutely increased, the CO2 pressure rises, and CO2 combines with CaO to form CaCO3, allowing the weight to fall. The heat given off by this reaction
raises the temperature in the cylinder, and heat flows to the bath. Decreasing the weight sets
off the opposite chain of events. The same results are obtained if the temperature of the bath is
raised or lowered. Raising the bath temperature slightly causes heat transfer into the cylinder,
and calcium carbonate decomposes. The CO2 generated causes the pressure to rise, which in
turn raises the piston and weight. This continues until the CaCO3 is completely decomposed.
A lowering of the bath temperature causes the system to return to its initial state. The imposition of differential changes causes only minute displacements of the system from equilibrium,
and the resulting process is exceedingly slow and reversible.

Figure 2.2: Reversibility of a chemical
reaction. The cylinder is fitted with a
frictionless piston and contains CaCO3, CaO,
and CO2 in equilibrium. It is immersed in
a constant-temperature bath, and thermal
equilibrium assures equality of the system
temperature with that of the bath. The
temperature is adjusted to a value such that
the decomposition pressure is just sufficient to
balance the weight on the piston, a condition of
mechanical equilibrium.

Some chemical reactions can be carried out in an electrolytic cell, and in this case they
may be held in balance by an applied potential difference. For example, when a cell consisting
of two electrodes, one of zinc and the other of platinum, is immersed in an aqueous solution of
hydrochloric acid, the reaction that occurs is:
	​
Zn + 2HCl ⇌ ​H​2​+ ​ZnCl​2​​	
The cell is held under fixed conditions of temperature and pressure, and the electrodes are
connected externally to a potentiometer. If the electromotive force (emf) produced by the cell

38

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

is exactly balanced by the potential difference of the potentiometer, the reaction is held in
equilibrium. The reaction may be made to proceed in the forward direction by a slight decrease
in the opposing potential difference, and it may be reversed by a corresponding increase in the
potential difference above the emf of the cell.

Summary Remarks on Reversible Processes
A reversible process:
∙ Can be reversed at any point by an infinitesimal change in external conditions
∙ Is never more than minutely removed from equilibrium
∙ Traverses a succession of equilibrium states
∙ Is frictionless
∙ Is driven by forces whose imbalance is infinitesimal in magnitude
∙ Proceeds infinitely slowly
∙ When reversed, retraces its path, restoring the initial state of system and surroundings

Computing Work for Reversible Processes
Equation (1.3) gives the work of compression or expansion of a gas caused by the displacement of a piston in a cylinder:
	​
dW = − P d​V​t​​	

(1.3)

The work done on the system is in fact given by this equation only when certain
­characteristics of the reversible process are realized. The first requirement is that the system be no more than infinitesimally displaced from a state of internal equilibrium, characterized by uniformity of temperature and pressure. The system then has an identifiable set of
properties, including pressure P. The second requirement is that the system be no more than
infinitesimally displaced from mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings. In this event,
the internal pressure P is never more than minutely out of balance with the external force, and
we may make the substitution F = PA that transforms Eq. (1.2) into Eq. (1.3). Processes for
which these requirements are met are said to be mechanically reversible, and Eq. (1.3) may be
integrated:
​ ​2t ​​ 
V

	​
W = −​ ​  ​P dV t ​ ​	
∫ ​V​1t ​​ 

(1.4)

This equation gives the work for the mechanically reversible expansion or compression of a
fluid in a piston/cylinder arrangement. Its evaluation clearly depends on the relation between
P and Vt, i.e., on the “path” of the process, which must be specified. To find the work of an
irreversible process for the same change in Vt, one needs an efficiency, which relates the actual
work to the reversible work.

39

2.7. Closed-System Reversible Processes; Enthalpy

Example 2.5
A horizontal piston/cylinder arrangement is placed in a constant-temperature bath.
The piston slides in the cylinder with negligible friction, and an external force holds it
in place against an initial gas pressure of 14 bar. The initial gas volume is 0.03 m3. The
external force on the piston is reduced gradually, and the gas expands isothermally
as its volume doubles. If the volume of the gas is related to its pressure so that PV t is
constant, what is the work done by the gas in moving the external force?

Solution 2.5
The process as described is mechanically reversible, and Eq. (1.4) is applicable. If
PV t = k, a constant, then P = k / V t. This specifies the path of the process, and leads to

CLOSED-SYSTEM REVERSIBLE PROCESSES; ENTHALPY

We present here the analysis of closed-system mechanically reversible processes—not that such
processes are common. Indeed they are of little interest for practical application. Their value
lies in the simplicity they provide for the calculation of changes in state functions for a specific
change of state. For a complex industrial process that brings about a particular change of state,
the calculation of changes in state functions are not made for the path of the actual process.
Rather, they are made for a simple closed-system reversible process that brings about the same
change of state. This is possible because changes in state functions are independent of process.
The closed-system mechanically reversible process is useful and important for this purpose, even
though close approximations to such hypothetical processes are not often encountered in practice.
For 1 mole of a homogeneous fluid contained in a closed system, the energy balance of
Eq. (2.6) is written:
	​
dU = dQ + dW​	

40

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

The work for a mechanically reversible, closed-system process is given by Eq. (1.3), here
­written: dW = −PdV. Substitution into the preceding equation yields:
	​
dU = dQ − PdV​	

(2.7)

This is the general energy balance for one mole or a unit mass of homogeneous fluid in a
closed system undergoing a mechanically reversible process.
For a constant-volume change of state, the only possible mechanical work is that associated with stirring or mixing, which is excluded because it is inherently irreversible. Thus,
	​
dU = dQ (const V )​	

(2.8)

Integration yields:
	​
ΔU = Q (const V )​	

(2.9)

The internal energy change for a mechanically reversible, constant-volume, closed-system
process equals the amount of heat transferred into the system.
For a constant-pressure change of state:
	​
​dU + PdV = d​(​U + PV​)​= dQ ​​	
The group U + PV naturally arises here and in many other applications. This suggests the
definition, for convenience, of this combination as a new thermodynamic property. Thus, the
mathematical (and only) definition of enthalpy7 is:
	​
​H ≡ U + PV​​	

(2.10)

where H, U, and V are molar or unit-mass values. The preceding energy balance becomes:
	​
dH = dQ (const P)​	

(2.11)

Integration yields:
	​
ΔH = Q (const P)​	

(2.12)

The enthalpy change in a mechanically reversible, constant-pressure, closed-system process equals the amount of heat transferred into the system. Comparison of Eqs. (2.11) and
(2.12) with Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) shows that the enthalpy plays a role in constant-pressure processes analogous to the internal energy in constant-volume processes.
These equations suggest the usefulness of enthalpy, but its greatest use becomes fully
apparent with its appearance in energy balances for flow processes as applied to heat exchangers, chemical and biochemical reactors, distillation columns, pumps, compressors, turbines,
engines, etc., for calculation of heat and work.
The tabulation of Q and W for the infinite array of conceivable processes is impossible.
The intensive state functions, however, such as molar or specific volume, internal energy, and
enthalpy, are intrinsic properties of matter. Once determined for a particular substance, their
values can be tabulated as functions of T and P for future use in the calculation of Q and W
7Originally and most properly pronounced en-thal′-py to distinguish it clearly from entropy, a property introduced
in Chapter 5, and pronounced en′-tro-py. The word enthalpy was proposed by H. Kamerlingh Onnes, who won the
1913 Nobel Prize in physics (see: http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1913/onnes-bio.html).

41

2.7. Closed-System Reversible Processes; Enthalpy

for any process involving that substance. The determination of numerical values for these state
functions and their correlation and use are treated in later chapters.
All terms of Eq. (2.10) must be expressed in the same units. The product PV has units
of energy per mole or per unit mass, as does U; therefore H also has units of energy per mole
or per unit mass. In the SI system the basic unit of pressure is the pascal (=1 N·m−2), and
that of molar volume is cubic meters per mol (=1 m3·mol−1). For the PV product we have
1 N·m·mol−1 = 1 J·mol−1.
Because U, P, and V are all state functions, H as defined by Eq. (2.10) is also a state
function. Like U and V, H is an intensive property of matter. The differential form of Eq.
(2.10) is:
	​
dH = dU + d(PV)​	

(2.13)

This equation applies for any differential change of state. Upon integration, it becomes
an equation for a finite change of state:
	​
ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV)​	

(2.14)

Equations (2.10), (2.13), and (2.14) apply to a unit mass or mole of a substance.

Example 2.6
Calculate ΔU and ΔH for 1 kg of water when it is vaporized at the constant temperature of 100°C and the constant pressure of 101.33 kPa. The specific volumes of liquid
and vapor water at these conditions are 0.00104 and 1.673 m3·kg−1, respectively. For
this change, heat in the amount of 2256.9 kJ is added to the water.

Solution 2.6
We take the 1 kg of water as the system because it alone is of interest, and we
imagine it contained in a cylinder by a frictionless piston that exerts a constant
pressure of 101.33 kPa. As heat is added, the water evaporates, expanding from its
initial to its final volume. Equation (2.12) as written for the 1 kg system is:
	​
ΔH = Q = 2256.9 kJ​	
By Eq. (2.14),
	​
ΔU = ΔH − Δ(PV ) = ΔH − P ΔV​	
For the final term:
P ΔV = 101.33 kPa × (1.673 − 0.001)​m​​3​
	​
​    
​
​
​​	
​
= 169.4 kPa⋅​m​3​= 169.4 kN⋅​m​−2​⋅m​​3​= 169.4 kJ
Then
	​
ΔU = 2256.9 − 169.4 = 2087.5 kJ​

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

HEAT CAPACITY

Our recognition of heat as energy in transit was preceded historically by the idea that gases,
liquids, and solids have capacity for heat. The smaller the temperature change caused in a
substance by the transfer of a given quantity of heat, the greater its capacity. Indeed, a heat
capacity might be defined as C ≡ dQ/dT. The difficulty with this is that it makes C, like Q, a
process-dependent quantity rather than a state function. However, it does suggest the definition of two quantities that, although they retain this outmoded name, are in fact state functions,
unambiguously related to other state functions. The discussion here is preliminary to more
complete treatment in Chapter 4.

Heat Capacity at Constant Volume
The constant-volume heat capacity of a substance is defined as:

∂U
	​
​CV​ ​≡ ​​ ___
​   ​ ​​  ​​​	
( ∂ T )V

(2.15)

Observe carefully the notation used here with the partial derivative. The parentheses and subscript V indicate that the derivative is taken with volume held constant; i.e., U is considered
a function of T and V. This notation is widely used in this text and more generally in thermodynamics. It is needed because thermodynamic state functions, like U, can be written as
functions of different sets of independent variables. Thus, we can write U(T, V) and U(T, P).
Ordinarily in multivariable calculus, a set of independent variables is unambiguous, and a partial derivative with respect to one variable implies constancy of the others. Because thermodynamics reflects physical reality, one may deal with alternative sets of independent variables,
introducing ambiguity unless the variables being held constant are explicitly specified.
The definition of Eq. (2.15) accommodates both the molar heat capacity and the specific
heat capacity (usually called specific heat), depending on whether U is the molar or specific
internal energy. Although this definition makes no reference to any process, it relates in an
especially simple way to a constant-volume process in a closed system, for which Eq. (2.15)
may be written:
	​
dU = ​CV​ ​dT (const V)​	

(2.16)

Integration yields:
T2

	​
ΔU = ​ ​  ​ ​ ​CV​ ​ dT ​(​const V​)​​	
∫ T1

(2.17)

This result with Eq. (2.9) for a mechanically reversible, constant-volume process (conditions that preclude stirring work) gives:
T2

	​
Q = ΔU = ​ ​  ​ ​ ​CV​ ​ dT (const V)​	
∫ T1

(2.18)

If the volume varies during the process but returns at the end of the process to its initial value, the process cannot rightly be called one of constant volume, even though V2 = V1
and ΔV = 0. However, changes in state functions are fixed by the initial and final conditions,

43

2.8. Heat Capacity

independent of path, and may therefore be calculated by equations for a truly constant-­volume
process regardless of the actual process. Equation (2.17) therefore has general validity,
because U, CV, T, and V are all state functions. On the other hand, Q and W depend on path.
Thus, Eq. (2.18) is a valid expression for Q, and W is in general zero, only for a constant-­
volume process. This is the reason for emphasizing the distinction between state functions and
path-dependent quantities such as Q and W. The principle that state functions are path- and
process-independent is an essential concept in thermodynamics.
For the calculation of property changes, but not for Q and W, an actual
process may be replaced by any other process that accomplishes the
same change in state. The choice is made based on convenience, with
simplicity a great advantage.

Heat Capacity at Constant Pressure
The constant-pressure heat capacity is defined as:

∂H
	​
​CP​ ​≡ ​​ ___
​   ​ ​​  ​​​	
( ∂ T )P

(2.19)

Again, the definition accommodates both molar and specific heat capacities, depending
on whether H is the molar or specific enthalpy. This heat capacity relates in an especially simple
way to a constant-pressure, closed-system process, for which Eq. (2.19) is equally well written:
	​
dH = ​CP​ ​dT (const P)​	
whence
T2

	​
ΔH =​ ​  ​​C
 ​ ​ ​dT (const P )​	
∫ T1 P

(2.20)
(2.21)

For a mechanically reversible, constant-P process, this result may be combined with
Eq. (2.12):
T2

	​
Q = ΔH = ​ ​  ​ ​ ​CP​ ​dT (const P)​	
∫ T1

(2.22)

Because H, CP, T, and P are state functions, Eq. (2.21) applies to any process for which P2 =
P1 whether or not it is actually carried out at constant pressure. However, only for the mechanically reversible, constant-pressure process can the amount of heat transferred be calculated by
Eq. (2.22) and work by Eq. (1.3), here written for 1 mole, W = −P ΔV.

Example 2.7
Air at 1 bar and 298.15 K is compressed to 3 bar and 298.15 K by two different
closed-system mechanically reversible processes:
(a) Cooling at constant pressure followed by heating at constant volume.
(b) Heating at constant volume followed by cooling at constant pressure.

44

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

Calculate the heat and work requirements and ΔU and ΔH of the air for each path. The
following heat capacities for air may be assumed independent of temperature:
	​
​C​V​= 20.785​ and​ ​C​P​= 29.100 J·​mol​​−1​·K​​−1​​	
Assume also that air remains a gas for which PV/T is a constant, regardless of the changes
it undergoes. At 298.15 K and 1 bar the molar volume of air is 0.02479 m3· mol−1.

Solution 2.7
In each case take the system as 1 mol of air contained in an imaginary piston/­
cylinder arrangement. Because the processes are mechanically reversible, the piston
is imagined to move in the cylinder without friction. The final volume is:
​P​1​

(a) During the first step of this path, air is cooled at the constant pressure of 1 bar until
the final volume of 0.008263 m3 is reached. The temperature of the air at the end of
this cooling step is:
​V​2​
0.008263

T′ = ​T​1​___
​ ​= 298.15​​ _
​
​ ​= 99.38 K​	
( 0.02479 )
​V​1​
Thus, for the first step,
Q = ΔH = ​CP​ ​ΔT = (29.100) (99.38 − 298.15) = −5784 J
	​​

ΔU = ΔH − Δ(PV) = ΔH − P ΔV = − 5784 + 1653 = − 4131 J

2.8. Heat Capacity

45

The second step is at constant V2 with heating to the final state. Work W = 0, and
for this step:
ΔU = Q = ​CV​ ​ΔT = (20.785) (298.15 − 99.38) = 4131 J
	​
​     
    
​ ​​	
V
ΔP​ = 0.008263 ​m​​3​× (2 × ​10​​5​) Pa = 1653 J​
ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV) = ΔU + V ΔP = 4131 + 1653 = 5784 J
For the overall process:
Q = −5784 + 4131 = −1653 J
W​ = 1653 + 0 = 1653 J​​
	​
​  
  
   
​​	
ΔU = − 4131 + 4131 = 0
ΔH = − 5784 + 5784 = 0
Notice that the first law, ΔU = Q + W, applied to the overall process is satisfied.
(b) Two different steps of this path produce the same final state of the air. In the first
step air is heated at a constant volume equal to V1 until the final pressure of 3 bar is
reached. The air temperature at the end of this step is:
​P​2​
3
	​
T′ = ​T​1​___
​ ​= 298.15​​ _
​ ​ ​= 894.45 K​	
(1)
​P​1​
For this first constant-volume step, W = 0, and
Q ​= ΔU = ​CV​ ​ΔT = ​(​20.785​)​(​894.45 − 298.15​)​= 12,394 J​
	​
​     
   
​​	
V
ΔP​​ ​= (​ ​0.02479​)(​ ​2 × ​10​​5)​ ​= 4958 J​​
ΔH = ΔU + V ΔP = 12,394 + 4958 = 17,352 J
In the second step air is cooled at P = 3 bar to its final state:
Q ​= ΔH = ​CP​ ​ ΔT = ​(​29.10​)​(​298.15 − 894.45​)​= − 17,352 J​
	​
​     
     
W​​ ​= −P ΔV = −(​ ​3 × ​10​​5)​ (​ ​0.008263 − 0.02479​)​= 4958 J​​ ​
​​	
ΔU ​= ΔH − Δ​(​PV​)​= ΔH − P ΔV = − 17,352 + 4958 = − 12,394 J​
For the two steps combined,
Q = 12,394 − 17,352 = − 4958 J
W = 0 + 4958 = 4958 J
	​
​   
  
   
​
​ ​
​​	
ΔU = 12,394 − 12,394 = 0
ΔH = 17,352 − 17,352 = 0
This example illustrates that changes in state functions (ΔU and ΔH) are independent of path for given initial and final states. On the other hand, Q and W
depend on the path. Note also that the total changes in ΔU and ΔH are zero. This
is because the input information provided makes U and H functions of temperature only, and T1 = T2. While the processes of this example are not of practical
interest, state-function changes (ΔU and ΔH) for actual flow processes are calculated as illustrated in this example for processes that are of practical interest.
This is possible because the state-function changes are the same for a reversible
process, like the ones used here, as for a real process that connects the same states.

46

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

Example 2.8
Calculate the internal energy and enthalpy changes resulting if air changes from an initial state of 5°C and 10 bar, where its molar volume is 2.312 × 10−3 m3·mol−1, to a final
state of 60°C and 1 bar. Assume also that air remains a gas for which PV/T is constant
and that CV = 20.785 and CP = 29.100 J·mol−1·K−1.

Solution 2.8
Because property changes are independent of process, calculations may be based
on any process that accomplishes the change. Here, we choose a two-step, mechanically reversible process wherein 1 mol of air is (a) cooled at constant volume to
the final pressure, and (b) heated at constant pressure to the final temperature. Of
course, other paths could be chosen, and would yield the same result.
	​
​T​1​= 5 + 273.15 = 278.15 K    ​T​2​= 60 + 273.15 = 333.15 K​	
With PV = kT, the ratio T/P is constant for step (a). The intermediate temperature
between the two steps is therefore:
	​
T′ = (278.15) (1 / 10) = 27.82 K​	
and the temperature changes for the two steps are:
Δ​T​ ​= 27.82 − 278.15 = −250.33 K
	​
   
​​ a
​​	
Δ​T​b​= 333.15 − 27.82 = 305.33 K
For step (a), by Eqs. (2.17) and (2.14),
Δ​Ua​ ​ ​= ​CV​ ​Δ​Ta​ ​= ​(​20.785​)​(​−250.33​)​= −5203.1 J​
Δ

​ ​Ha​   
​
​​	
​ ​= −5203.1 J + 2.312 × ​10​​−3​​m​​3​× ​(​−9 × ​10​​5​)​Pa = − 7283.9 J​
For step (b), the final volume of the air is:
​P​1​​T​2​
10 × 333.15
	​
​V​2​= ​V​1​____

​P​2​​T​1​
By Eqs. (2.21) and (2.14),
Δ​H​b​ = ​CP​ ​Δ​T​b​= (29.100) (305.33) = 8885.1 J
Δ​

​    
​
​​	
​ = 8885.1 − (1 × ​10​​5​) (0.02769 − 0.00231) = 6347.1 J
For the two steps together,
ΔU = − 5203.1 + 6347.1 = 1144.0 J
   
​ ​
​
ΔH = − 7283.9 + 8885.1 = 1601.2 J
These values would be the same for any process that results in the same change of state.8
8You might be concerned that the path selected here goes through an intermediate state where, in reality, air
would not be a gas, but would condense. Paths for thermodynamic calculations often proceed through such hypothetical states that cannot be physically realized but are nonetheless useful and appropriate for the calculation. Additional
such states will be encountered repeatedly in later chapters.

MASS AND ENERGY BALANCES FOR OPEN SYSTEMS

Although the focus of the preceding sections has been on closed systems, the concepts presented find far more extensive application. The laws of mass and energy conservation apply to
all processes, to open as well as to closed systems. Indeed, the open system includes the closed
system as a special case. The remainder of this chapter is therefore devoted to the treatment of
open systems and thus to the development of equations of wide practical application.

Measures of Flow
Open systems are characterized by flowing streams; there are four common measures of flow:
∙ Mass flow rate, ​m˙ ​​   ∙ Molar flow rate, ​n˙​​   ∙ Volumetric flow rate, q  ∙ Velocity, u
The measures of flow are interrelated:
	​
​m˙ ​= ℳ​n˙​   and   q = uA​	
where ℳ is molar mass and A is the cross-sectional area for flow. Importantly, mass and molar
flow rates relate to velocity:
​m˙ ​= uAρ​	

(2.23a)

​n˙​= uAρ​	

(2.23b)

The area for flow A is the cross-sectional area of a conduit, and ρ is specific or molar
density. Although velocity is a vector quantity, its scalar magnitude u is used here as the average speed of a stream in the direction normal to A. Flow rates ​m˙ ​​, ​n​˙ ​​, and q represent measures
of quantity per unit of time. Velocity u is quite different in nature, as it does not suggest the
magnitude of flow. Nevertheless, it is an important design parameter.

Example 2.9
In a major human artery with an internal diameter of 5 mm, the flow of blood, averaged
over the cardiac cycle, is 5 cm3·s−1. The artery bifurcates (splits) into two identical
blood vessels that are each 3 mm in diameter. What are the average velocity and
the mass flow rate upstream and downstream of the bifurcation? The density of blood
is 1.06 g·cm−3.

Solution 2.9
The average velocity is given by the volumetric flow rate divided by the area for
flow. Thus, upstream of the bifurcation, where the vessel diameter is 0.5 cm,
q _____________
5 ​cm​​3​⋅s​​−1​
	​
​u​up​= __
​ ​=   
​  
​= 25.5 cm⋅​s​−1​​	
A (π / 4) (​0.5​​2​​cm​​2​)

48

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts
Downstream of the bifurcation, the volumetric flow rate in each vessel is
2.5 cm3·s−1, and the vessel diameter is 0.3 cm. Thus,

2.5 ​cm​​3​⋅s​​−1​
	​
​u​down​= _____________
​  
  
​= 35.4 cm​⋅s​​−1​​	
(π / 4) (​0.3​​2​ ​cm​​2​)
The mass flow rate in the upstream vessel is given by the volumetric flow rate
times the density:
	​
​m˙ ​up = 5 ​cm​​3​⋅s​​−1​× 1.06 g⋅​cm​​−3​= 5.30 g⋅​s​−1​​	
Similarly, for each downstream vessel:
	​
​m˙ ​down = 2.5 ​cm​​3​⋅s​​−3​× 1.06 g⋅​cm​​−3​= 2.65 g⋅​s​−1​​	
which is of course half the upstream value.

Mass Balance for Open Systems
The region of space identified for analysis of open systems is called a control volume; it is
separated from its surroundings by a control surface. The fluid within the control volume is
the thermodynamic system for which mass and energy balances are written. Because mass is
conserved, the rate of change of mass within the control volume, dmcv /dt, equals the net rate
of flow of mass into the control volume. The convention is that flow is positive when directed
into the control volume and negative when directed out. The mass balance is expressed mathematically by:
d​m​cv​
	​
​_​+ Δ ​(​m˙ ​)​fs​ = 0​​
dt

(2.24)

For the control volume of Fig. 2.4, the second term is:

and ​m
˙ ​2 are shown directed into the control
volume, and one stream with flow rate ​m
˙ ​3
is directed out.

49

2.9. Mass and Energy Balances for Open Systems

The difference operator Δ here signifies the difference between exit and entrance flows, and
the subscript “fs” indicates that the term applies to all flowing streams. Note that this is a
different usage of this operator compared with previous sections, where the difference was
between an initial state and a final state. Both usages of the difference operator are common,
and care must be taken to ensure that the correct sense is understood.
When the mass flow rate ​m˙ ​is given by Eq. (2.23a), Eq. (2.24) becomes:
d​m​cv​
	​
​_____​+ Δ ​(ρuA)​fs​= 0​	
dt

(2.25)

In this form the mass-balance equation is often called the continuity equation.
Steady-state flow processes are those for which conditions within the control volume
do not change with time. These are an important class of flow processes often encountered in
practice. In a steady-state process, the control volume contains a constant mass of fluid, and
the first or accumulation term of Eq. (2.24) is zero, reducing Eq. (2.25) to:
	​
Δ ​(ρuA)​fs​= 0​	
The term “steady state” does not necessarily imply that flow rates are constant, merely
that the inflow of mass is exactly matched by the outflow of mass.
When there is a single entrance and a single exit stream, the mass flow rate ​m˙ ​ is the
same for both streams; then,
	​
​m˙ ​= const = ​ρ​2​​u​2​​A​2​= ​ρ​1​​u​1​​A​1​​	
Because specific volume is the reciprocal of density,
​u​1​​A​1​ _

	​
​m˙ ​= _
​
​= ​
​= ​ ​
​V​1​

(2.26)

This form of the continuity equation finds frequent use.

The General Energy Balance
Because energy, like mass, is conserved, the rate of change of energy within the control volume
equals the net rate of energy transfer into the control volume. Streams flowing into and out of
the control volume have associated with them energy in its internal, potential, and kinetic forms,
and all may contribute to the energy change of the system. Each unit mass of a stream carries
with it a total energy ​U + _​12 ​​u​2​+ zg​, where u is the average velocity of the stream, z is its elevation above a datum level, and g is the local acceleration of gravity. Thus, each stream transports
energy at the rate (​ ​U + _​12 ​​u​2​+ zg​)​m˙ ​. The net energy transported into the system by the flowing streams is therefore −Δ​
​​ [(​ U + _​12 ​​u​2​+ zg)​m˙ ​] ​​  ​​​, where the effect of the minus sign with “Δ” is
fs
to make the term read in – out. The rate of energy accumulation within the control volume
includes this quantity in addition to the heat transfer rate Q
​​˙ ​​and work rate:

The work rate may include work of several forms. First, work is associated with moving
the flowing streams through entrances and exits. The fluid at any entrance or exit has a set
of average properties, P, V, U, H, etc. Imagine that a unit mass of fluid with these properties
exists at an entrance or exit, as shown in Fig. 2.5. This unit mass of fluid is acted upon by
additional fluid, here replaced by a piston that exerts the constant pressure P. The work done
by this piston in moving the unit mass through the entrance is PV, and the work rate is (PV) ​m

Because Δ denotes the difference between exit and entrance quantities, the net work done on
the system when all entrance and exit sections are taken into account is −
​ Δ​[(PV) ​m˙ ​]​fs​​.

Another form of work is the shaft work9 indicated in Fig. 2.5 by rate ​​W
work may be associated with expansion or contraction of the∙ entire control volume. These
forms of work are all included in a rate term represented by W

now be written:

The velocity u in the kinetic-energy terms is the bulk-mean velocity as defined by the

equation u = m

9Mechanical work added to or removed from the system without transfer of mass is called shaft work because it is
often transferred by means of a rotating shaft, like that in a turbine or compressor. However, this term is used more
broadly to include work transferred by other mechanical means as well.

2.9. Mass and Energy Balances for Open Systems

the wall (the no-slip condition) to a maximum at the center of the pipe. The kinetic energy of a
fluid in a pipe depends on its velocity profile. For the case of laminar flow, the profile is parabolic, and integration across the pipe shows that the kinetic-energy term should properly be u2.
In fully developed turbulent flow, the more common case in practice, the velocity across the
major portion of the pipe is not far from uniform, and the expression u2/2, as used in the energy
equations, is more nearly correct.
Although Eq. (2.27) is an energy balance of reasonable generality, it has limitations.
In particular, it reflects the tacit assumption that the center of mass of the control volume is
stationary. Thus no terms for kinetic- and potential-energy changes of the fluid in the control
volume are included. For virtually all applications of interest to chemical engineers, Eq. (2.27)
is adequate. For many (but not all) applications, kinetic- and potential-­energy changes in the
flowing streams are also negligible, and Eq. (2.27) then simplifies to:
d​  (mU)​  cv​​

Example 2.10
Show that Eq. (2.28) reduces to Eq. (2.3) for the case of a closed system.

One must be aware of its context to discern its meaning.

Example 2.11
An insulated, electrically heated tank for hot water contains 190 kg of liquid water
at 60°C. Imagine you are taking a shower using water from this tank when a power

outage occurs. If water is withdrawn from the tank at a steady rate of m
​​ ​​ = 0.2 kg·s−1,

52

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

how long will it take for the temperature of the water in the tank to drop from 60 to
35°C? Assume that cold water enters the tank at 10°C and that heat losses from the
tank are negligible. Here, an excellent assumption for liquid water is that Cv = Cp = C,
independent of T and P.

Solution 2.11
This is an example of the application of Eq. (2.28) to a transient process for which
•
˙ ​ = 0​. We assume perfect mixing of the contents of the tank; this implies
​​Q ​​​  = ​W
that the properties of the water leaving the tank are those of the water in the tank.
With the mass flow rate into the tank equal to the mass flow rate out, mcv is
constant; moreover, the differences between inlet and outlet kinetic and potential
energies can be neglected. Equation (2.28) is therefore written:
dU
	​
m ___
​ ​+ ​m˙ ​(H − ​H​1​) = 0​

where unsubscripted quantities refer to the contents of the tank (and therefore the
water leaving the tank) and H1 is the specific enthalpy of the water entering the
tank. With CV = CP = C,

Thus, the water temperature in the tank will drop from 60 to 35°C after about
11 minutes.

Energy Balances for Steady-State Flow Processes
Flow processes for which the accumulation term of Eq. (2.27), d(mU)cv/dt, is zero are said to
occur at steady state. As discussed with respect to the mass balance, this means that the mass

2.9. Mass and Energy Balances for Open Systems

53

of the system within the control volume is constant; it also means that no changes occur with
time in the properties of the fluid within the control volume nor at its entrances and exits. No
expansion of the control volume is possible under these circumstances. The only work of the
process is shaft work, and the general energy balance, Eq. (2.27), becomes:
∙

​   ​ ​u​2​+ zg ​  ​m˙ ​  ​ = ​Q ​​​  + ​​W​​  s​​​​​

fs

(2.29)

Although “steady state” does not necessarily imply “steady flow,” the usual application of
this equation is to steady-state, steady-flow processes, because such processes represent the
industrial norm.10
A further specialization results when the control volume has one entrance and one exit.
The same mass flow rate ​m
​˙ ​​then applies to both streams, and Eq. (2.29) reduces to:

(2.31)

This equation is the mathematical expression of the first law for a steady-state, steady-flow
process between one entrance and one exit. All terms represent energy per unit mass of fluid.
The energy unit is usually the joule.
In many applications, kinetic- and potential-energy terms are omitted because they are
negligible compared with other terms.11 For such cases, Eq. (2.31) reduces to:
	​
ΔH = Q + ​Ws​​​	

(2.32)

This expression of the first law for a steady-state, steady-flow process is analogous to Eq. (2.3)
for a nonflow process. However, in Eq. (2.32), enthalpy rather than internal energy is the thermodynamic property of importance, and Δ refers to a change from inlet to outlet, rather than
from before to after an event.

10An example of a steady-state process that is not steady flow is a water heater, in which variations in flow rate are
exactly compensated by changes in the rate of heat transfer, so that temperatures throughout remain constant.
11Notable exceptions include applications to nozzles, metering devices, wind tunnels, and hydroelectric power
stations.

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts

A Flow Calorimeter for Enthalpy Measurements
The application of Eqs. (2.31) and (2.32) to the solution of practical problems requires enthalpy
values. Because H is a state function, its values depend only on point conditions; once determined, they may be tabulated for subsequent use for the same sets of conditions. To this end,
Eq. (2.32) may be applied to laboratory processes designed for enthalpy measurements.

Figure 2.6: Flow calorimeter.

A simple flow calorimeter is illustrated schematically in Fig. 2.6. Its essential feature
is an electric resistance heater immersed in a flowing fluid. The design provides for minimal
velocity and elevation changes from section 1 to section 2, making kinetic- and potential-­energy
changes of the fluid negligible. With no shaft work entering the system, Eq. (2.32) reduces to
ΔH = H2 − H1= Q. The rate of heat transfer to the fluid is determined from the resistance of
the heater and the current passing through it. In practice a number of details require careful
attention, but in principle the operation of the flow calorimeter is simple. Measurements of the
heat transfer rate and flow rate allow calculation of the change ΔH between sections 1 and 2.
For example, enthalpies of both liquid and vapor H2O are readily determined. The
­constant-temperature bath is filled with a mixture of crushed ice and water to maintain a temperature of 0°C. Liquid water is supplied to the apparatus, and the coil that carries it through
the constant-temperature bath is long enough to bring it to an exit temperature of essentially
0°C. The temperature and pressure at section 2 are measured by suitable instruments. Values
of the enthalpy of H2O for various conditions at section 2 are given by:
	​
​H​2​ = ​H​1​+ Q ​	
where Q is the heat added per unit mass of water flowing.
The pressure may vary from run to run, but in the range encountered here it has a negligible effect on the enthalpy of the entering water, and for practical purposes H1 is a constant. Absolute values of enthalpy, like absolute values of internal energy, are unknown. An
­arbitrary value may therefore be assigned to H1 as the basis for all other enthalpy values.
Setting H1 = 0 for liquid water at 0°C makes:
	​
​H​2​ = ​H​1​+ Q = 0 + Q = Q ​	

2.9. Mass and Energy Balances for Open Systems

55

Enthalpy values may be tabulated for the temperatures and pressures existing at section
2 for a large number of runs. In addition, specific-volume measurements made for these same
conditions may be added to the table, along with corresponding values of the internal energy
calculated by Eq. (2.10), U = H − PV. In this way, tables of thermodynamic properties are
compiled over the entire useful range of conditions. The most widely used such tabulation is
for H2O and is known as the steam tables.12
The enthalpy may be taken as zero for some other state than liquid at 0°C. The choice is
arbitrary. The equations of thermodynamics, such as Eqs. (2.31) and (2.32), apply to changes
of state, for which the enthalpy differences are independent of the location of the zero point.
However, once an arbitrary zero point is selected for the enthalpy, an arbitrary choice cannot
be made for the internal energy, because internal energy is related to enthalpy by Eq. (2.10).

Example 2.12
For the flow calorimeter just discussed, the following data are taken with water as the
test fluid:
​t​1​= 0° C​
​t​2​= 300° C​
​P​2​= 3 bar​​
	​
​Flow rate = 4.15 g⋅​s​−1​
	​
Rate of heat addition from resistance heater = 12,740 W​
The water is completely vaporized in the process. Calculate the enthalpy of steam at
300°C and 3 bar based on H = 0 for liquid water at 0°C.

Solution 2.12
If Δz and Δu2 are negligible and if Ws and H1 are zero, then H2 = Q, and
12,740 J⋅​s​−1​
	​
​H​2​= __________
​
​= 3070 J⋅​g​−1​  or  3070 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	
4.15 g⋅​s​−1​

Example 2.13
Air at 1 bar and 25°C enters a compressor at low velocity, discharges at 3 bar, and
enters a nozzle in which it expands to a final velocity of 600 m·s−1 at the initial conditions of pressure and temperature. If the work of compression is 240 kJ per kilogram
of air, how much heat must be removed during compression?

12Steam tables adequate for many purposes are given in Appendix E. The Chemistry WebBook of NIST includes
a fluid properties calculator with which one can generate tables for water and some 75 other substances: http://­

Solution 2.13
Because the air returns to its initial conditions of T and P, the overall process produces no change in enthalpy of the air. Moreover, the potential-energy change of
the air is presumed negligible. Neglecting also the initial kinetic energy of the air,
we write Eq. (2.31) as:

Then

​

​Q = 180 − 240 = − 60 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​

Heat in the amount of 60 kJ must be removed per kilogram of air compressed.

Example 2.14
Water at 90°C is pumped from a storage tank at a rate of 3 L·s−1. The motor for the pump
supplies work at a rate of 1.5 kJ·s−1. The water goes through a heat exchanger, giving up
heat at a rate of 670 kJ·s−1, and is delivered to a second storage tank at an elevation 15 m
above the first tank. What is the temperature of the water delivered to the second tank?

Solution 2.14
This is a steady-state, steady-flow process for which Eq. (2.31) applies. The initial
and final velocities of water in the storage tanks are negligible, and the term Δu2/2

57

2.9. Mass and Energy Balances for Open Systems
may be omitted. All remaining terms are expressed in units of kJ·kg−1. At 90°C
the density of water is 0.965 kg·L−1 and the mass flow rate is:
	​
​m˙ ​= (3) (0.965) = 2.895 kg⋅​s​−1​​	

m· = 2.895 kg s −1

∆z = 15 m

·
Q = −670 kJ s −1

·
Ws = 1.5 kJ s −1

For the heat exchanger,
	​
Q = − 670 / 2.895 = − 231.4 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	
For the shaft work of the pump,
	​
​Ws​​= 1.5 / 2.895 = 0.52 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	
If g is taken as the standard value of 9.8 m·s−2, the potential-energy term is:
gΔz = (9.8) (15) = 147 ​m​​2​⋅s​​−2​
	​
   
​
​ ​​	
       = 147 J⋅​kg​​−1​= 0.147 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​
Equation (2.31) now yields:
	​
ΔH = Q + ​Ws​​− gΔz = − 231.4 + 0.52 − 0.15 = − 231.03 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	
The steam-table value for the enthalpy of liquid water at 90°C is:
	​
​H​1​= 376.9 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	
Thus,
	​
ΔH = ​H​2​− ​H​1​= ​H​2​− 376.9 = − 231.0​	
and
	​
​H​2​= 376.9 − 231.0 = 145.9 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	

58

CHAPTER 2. The First Law and Other Basic Concepts
The temperature of water having this enthalpy is found from the steam tables:

	​
t = 34.83° C​	
In this example, Ws and gΔz are small compared with Q, and for practical p­ urposes
could be neglected.

Example 2.15
A steam turbine operates adiabatically with a power output of 4000 kW. Steam enters
the turbine at 2100 kPa and 475°C. The exhaust is saturated steam at 10 kPa that
enters a condenser, where it is condensed and cooled to 30°C. What is the mass flow
rate of the steam, and at what rate must cooling water be supplied to the condenser, if
the water enters at 15°C and is heated to 25°C?

Solution 2.15
The enthalpies of entering and exiting steam from the turbine are found from the
steam tables:
	​
​H​1​= 3411.3 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​   and    ​H​2​= 2584.8 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​​	
For a properly designed turbine, kinetic- and potential-energy changes are
­negligible,
and for adiabatic operation Q = 0. Eq. (2.32) becomes simply Ws = ΔH.

2.18. In addition to heat and work flows, energy can be transferred as light, as in a photovoltaic device (solar cell). The energy content of light depends on both its wavelength
(color) and its intensity. When sunlight impinges on a solar cell, some is reflected,
some is absorbed and converted to electrical work, and some is absorbed and converted to heat. Consider an array of solar cells with an area of 3 m2. The power of
sunlight impinging upon it is 1 kW⋅m−2. The array converts 17% of the incident power
to electrical work, and it reflects 20% of the incident light. At steady state, what is the
rate of heat removal from the solar cell array?

Chapter 3
Volumetric Properties
of Pure Fluids

The equations of the preceding chapter provide the means for calculation of the heat and
work quantities associated with various processes, but they are useless without knowledge of
property values for internal energy or enthalpy. Such properties differ from one substance to
another, and the laws of thermodynamics themselves do not provide any description or model
of material behavior. Property values come from experiment, or from the correlated results of
experiment, or from models grounded in and validated by experiment. Because there are no
internal-energy or enthalpy meters, indirect measurement is the rule. For fluids, the most comprehensive procedure requires measurements of molar volume in relation to temperature and
pressure. The resulting pressure/volume/temperature (PVT ) data are most usefully correlated
by equations of state, through which molar volume (or density), temperature, and pressure are
functionally related.
In this chapter we:
∙ Present the phase rule, which relates the number of independent variables required to fix
the thermodynamic state of a system to the number of chemical species and phases present
∙ Describe qualitatively the general nature of PVT behavior of pure substances
∙ Provide a detailed treatment of the ideal-gas state
∙ Treat equations of state, which are mathematical formulations of the PVT behavior of fluids
∙ Introduce generalized correlations that allow prediction of the PVT behavior of fluids
for which experimental data are lacking

3.1

THE PHASE RULE

As indicated in Section 2.5, the state of a pure homogeneous fluid is fixed whenever two
intensive thermodynamic properties are set at specific values. In contrast, when two phases
of the same pure species are in equilibrium, the state of the system is fixed when only a single property is specified. For example, a system of steam and liquid water in equilibrium at
68

3.1. The Phase Rule

69

101.33 kPa can exist only at 100°C. It is impossible to change the temperature without also
changing the pressure, if equilibrium between vapor and liquid phases is to be maintained.
There is a single independent variable.
For a multiphase system at equilibrium, the number of independent variables that must
be arbitrarily fixed to establish its intensive state is called the number of degrees of freedom of
the system. This number is given by the phase rule of J. Willard Gibbs.1 It is presented here
without proof in the form applicable to nonreacting systems:2
	​
​F = 2 − π + N​​	

(3.1)

where F is the number of degrees of freedom, π is the number of phases, and N is the number
of chemical species present in the system.
The intensive state of a system at equilibrium is established when its temperature, pressure,
and the compositions of all phases are fixed. These are the variables of the phase rule, but they
are not all independent. The phase rule gives the number of variables from this set that must be
specified to fix all remaining intensive variables, and thus the intensive state of the system.
A phase is a homogeneous region of matter. A gas or a mixture of gases, a liquid or a
liquid solution, and a crystalline solid are examples of phases. An abrupt change in properties
always occurs at the boundary between phases. Various phases can coexist, but they must
be in equilibrium for the phase rule to apply. A phase need not be continuous; examples of
discontinuous phases are a gas dispersed as bubbles in a liquid, a liquid dispersed as droplets
in another liquid with which it is immiscible, and solid crystals dispersed in either a gas or a
liquid. In each case a dispersed phase is distributed throughout a continuous phase.
As an example, the phase rule may be applied to an aqueous solution of ethanol in equilibrium with its vapor. Here N = 2, π = 2, and
	​
F = 2 − π + N = 2 − 2 + 2 = 2​	
This is a system in vapor/liquid equilibrium, and it has two degrees of freedom. If the system
exists at specified T and P (assuming this is possible), its liquid- and vapor-phase compositions are fixed by these conditions. A more common specification is of T and the liquid-phase
composition, in which case P and the vapor-phase composition are fixed.
Intensive variables are independent of the size of the system and of the individual
phases. Thus, the phase rule gives the same information for a large system as for a small one
and for different relative amounts of the phases. Moreover, the phase rule applies only to
individual-phase compositions, and not to the overall composition of a multiphase system.
Note also that for a phase only N − 1 compositions are independent, because the mole or mass
fractions of a phase must sum to unity.
The minimum number of degrees of freedom for any system is zero. When F = 0, the
system is invariant; Eq. (3.1) becomes π = 2 + N. This value of π is the maximum number
of phases that can coexist at equilibrium for a system containing N chemical species. When
N = 1, this limit is reached for π = 3, characteristic of a triple point (Sec. 3.2). For example, the
1Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903), American mathematical physicist, who deduced it in 1875. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Gibbs
2The theoretical justification of the phase rule for nonreacting systems is given in Sec. 12.2, and the phase rule for
reacting systems is considered in Sec. 14.8.

70

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

triple point of H2O, where liquid, vapor, and the common form of ice exist together in equilibrium, occurs at 0.01°C and 0.0061 bar. Any change from these conditions causes at least one
phase to disappear.

Example 3.1
How many phase-rule variables must be specified to fix the thermodynamic state of
each of the following systems?
(a) Liquid water in equilibrium with its vapor.
(b) Liquid water in equilibrium with a mixture of water vapor and nitrogen.
(c) A three-phase system of a saturated aqueous salt solution at its boiling point
with excess salt crystals present.

Solution 3.1
(a) The system contains a single chemical species existing as two phases (one
liquid and one vapor), and
	​
F = 2 − π + N = 2 − 2 + 1 = 1​	
This result is in agreement with the fact that for a given pressure water has but one
boiling point. Temperature or pressure, but not both, may be specified for a system
comprised of water in equilibrium with its vapor.
(b) Two chemical species are present. Again there are two phases, and
	​
F = 2 − π + N = 2 − 2 + 2 = 2​	
The addition of an inert gas to a system of water in equilibrium with its vapor
changes the characteristics of the system. Now temperature and pressure may be
independently varied, but once they are fixed the system described can exist in
equilibrium only at a particular composition of the vapor phase. (If nitrogen is
considered negligibly soluble in water, the liquid phase is pure water.)
(c) The three phases (π = 3) are crystalline salt, the saturated aqueous solution,
and vapor generated at the boiling point. The two chemical species (N = 2) are
water and salt. For this system,
F=2−3+2=1

3.2 PVT BEHAVIOR OF PURE SUBSTANCES
Figure 3.1 displays the equilibrium conditions of P and T at which solid, liquid, and gas phases
of a pure substance exist. Lines 1-2 and 2-C represent the conditions at which solid and liquid phases exist in equilibrium with a vapor phase. These vapor pressure versus temperature

3.2. PVT Behavior of Pure Substances

lines describe states of solid/vapor (line 1-2) and liquid/vapor (line 2-C) equilibrium. As indicated
in Ex. 3.1(a), such systems have but a single degree of freedom. Similarly, solid/liquid
­equilibrium is represented by line 2-3. The three lines display conditions of P and T at which
two phases may coexist, and they divide the diagram into single-phase regions. Line 1-2, the
­sublimation curve, separates the solid and gas regions; line 2-3, the fusion curve, ­separates
the solid and liquid regions; line 2-C, the vaporization curve, separates the liquid and gas
regions. Point C is known as the critical point; its coordinates Pc and Tc are the highest pressure
and highest temperature at which a pure chemical species is observed to exist in vapor/liquid
equilibrium.
The positive slope of the fusion line (2-3) represents the behavior of the vast majority
of substances. Water, a very common substance, has some very uncommon properties, and
exhibits a fusion line with negative slope.
The three lines meet at the triple point, where the three phases coexist in equilibrium.
According to the phase rule the triple point is invariant (F = 0). If the system exists along any
of the two-phase lines of Fig. 3.1, it is univariant (F = 1), whereas in the single-phase regions
it is divariant (F = 2). Invariant, univariant, and divariant states appear as points, curves, and
areas, respectively, on a PT diagram.
Changes of state can be represented by lines on the PT diagram: a constant-T change by
a vertical line, and a constant-P change by a horizontal line. When such a line crosses a phase
boundary, an abrupt change in properties of the fluid occurs at constant T and P; for example,
vaporization for the transition from liquid to vapor.

Water in an open flask is obviously a liquid in contact with air. If the flask is sealed and
the air is pumped out, water vaporizes to replace the air, and H2O fills the flask. Though the
pressure in the flask is much reduced, everything appears unchanged. The liquid water resides
at the bottom of the flask because its density is much greater than that of water vapor (steam),
and the two phases are in equilibrium at conditions represented by a point on curve 2-C of
Fig. 3.1. Far from point C, the properties of liquid and vapor are very different. However, if

72

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

the temperature is raised so that the equilibrium state progresses upward along curve 2-C,
the properties of the two phases become more and more nearly alike; at point C they become
identical, and the meniscus disappears. One consequence is that transitions from liquid to
vapor may occur along paths that do not cross the vaporization curve 2-C, i.e., from A to B.
The transition from liquid to gas is gradual and does not include the usual vaporization step.
The region existing at temperatures and pressures greater than Tc and Pc is marked off
by dashed lines in Fig. 3.1; these do not represent phase boundaries, but rather are limits fixed
by the meanings accorded the words liquid and gas. A phase is generally considered a liquid
if vaporization results from pressure reduction at constant temperature. A phase is considered
a gas if condensation results from temperature reduction at constant pressure. Since neither
process can be initiated in the region beyond the dashed lines, it is called the fluid region.
The gas region is sometimes divided into two parts, as indicated by the dotted vertical
line of Fig. 3.1. A gas to the left of this line, which can be condensed either by compression at
constant temperature or by cooling at constant pressure, is called a vapor. A fluid existing at a
temperature greater than Tc is said to be supercritical. An example is atmospheric air.

PV Diagram
Figure 3.1 does not provide any information about volume; it merely displays the boundaries between single-phase regions. On a PV diagram [Fig. 3.2(a)] these boundaries in turn
become regions where two phases—solid/liquid, solid/vapor, and liquid/vapor—coexist in
equilibrium. The curves that outline these two-phase regions represent single phases that are
in equilibrium. Their relative amounts determine the molar (or specific) volumes within the
two-phase regions. The triple point of Fig. 3.1 here becomes a triple line, where the three
phases with different values of V coexist at a single temperature and pressure.
Figure 3.2(a), like Fig. 3.1, represents the behavior of the vast majority of substances
wherein the transition from liquid to solid (freezing) is accompanied by a decrease in specific
volume (increase in density), and the solid phase sinks in the liquid. Here again water displays unusual behavior in that freezing results in an increase in specific volume (decrease in
density), and on Fig. 3.2(a) the lines labeled solid and liquid are interchanged for water. Ice
therefore floats on liquid water. Were it not so, the conditions on the earth’s surface would be
vastly different.
Figure 3.2(b) is an expanded view of the liquid, liquid/vapor, and vapor regions of the
PV diagram, with four isotherms (paths of constant T) superimposed. Isotherms on Fig. 3.1
are vertical lines, and at temperatures greater than Tc do not cross a phase boundary. On
Fig. 3.2(b) the isotherm labeled T > Tc is therefore smooth.
The lines labeled T1 and T2 are for subcritical temperatures and consist of three segments. The horizontal segment of each isotherm represents all possible mixtures of liquid and
vapor in equilibrium, ranging from 100% liquid at the left end to 100% vapor at the right end.
The locus of these end points is the dome-shaped curve labeled BCD, the left half of which
(from B to C) represents single-phase liquids at their vaporization (boiling) temperatures and
the right half (from C to D) single-phase vapors at their condensation temperatures. Liquids
and vapors represented by BCD are said to be saturated, and coexisting phases are connected
by the horizontal segment of the isotherm at the saturation pressure specific to the isotherm.
Also called the vapor pressure, it is given by a point on Fig. 3.1 where an isotherm (vertical
line) crosses the vaporization curve.

Figure 3.2: PV diagrams for a pure substance. (a) Showing solid, liquid, and gas regions. (b) Showing
liquid, liquid/vapor, and vapor regions with isotherms.

The two-phase liquid/vapor region lies under dome BCD; the subcooled-liquid region
lies to the left of the saturated-liquid curve BC, and the superheated-vapor region lies to the
right of the saturated-vapor curve CD. Subcooled liquid exists at temperatures below, and
superheated vapor, at temperatures above the boiling point for the given pressure. Isotherms
in the subcooled-liquid region are very steep because liquid volumes change little with large
changes in pressure.
The horizontal segments of the isotherms in the two-phase region become progressively
shorter at higher temperatures, being ultimately reduced to a point at C. Thus, the critical isotherm, labeled Tc, exhibits a horizontal inflection at the critical point C at the top of the dome,
where the liquid and vapor phases become indistinguishable.

Critical Behavior
Insight into the nature of the critical point is gained from a description of the changes that
occur when a pure substance is heated in a sealed upright tube of constant volume. The dotted
vertical lines of Fig. 3.2(b) indicate such processes. They may also be traced on the PT ­diagram
of Fig. 3.3, where the solid line is the vaporization curve (Fig. 3.1), and the dashed lines are
constant-volume paths in the single-phase regions. If the tube is filled with either liquid or
vapor, the heating process produces changes that lie along the dashed lines of Fig. 3.3, for
example, by the change from E to F (subcooled-liquid) and by the change from G to H (superheated-vapor). The corresponding vertical lines on Fig. 3.2(b) are not shown, but they lie to the
left and right of BCD respectively.
If the tube is only partially filled with liquid (the remainder being vapor in equilibrium
with the liquid), heating at first causes changes described by the vapor-pressure curve (solid

line of Fig. 3.3). For the process indicated by line JQ on Fig. 3.2(b), the meniscus is initially
near the top of the tube (point J), and the liquid expands sufficiently upon heating to fill the
tube (point Q). On Fig. 3.3 the process traces a path from (J, K) to Q, and with further heating
departs from the vapor-pressure curve along the line of constant molar volume V​
​​ 2l ​​.​ 
The process indicated by line KN on Fig. 3.2(b) starts with a meniscus level closer to
the bottom of the tube (point K), and heating vaporizes liquid, causing the meniscus to recede
to the bottom (point N). On Fig. 3.3 the process traces a path from (J, K) to N. With further
heating the path continues along the line of constant molar volume V​ 
​​ 2v​  ​​.
For a unique filling of the tube, with a particular intermediate meniscus level, the heating
process follows a vertical line on Fig. 3.2(b) that passes through the critical point C.
Physically, heating does not produce much change in the level of the meniscus. As the ­critical
point is approached, the meniscus becomes indistinct, then hazy, and finally disappears.
On Fig. 3.3 the path first follows the vapor-pressure curve, proceeding from point (J, K) to
the critical point C, where it enters the single-phase fluid region, and follows Vc, the line of
constant molar volume equal to the critical volume of the fluid.3

PVT Surfaces
For a pure substance, existing as a single phase, the phase rule tells us that two state variables
must be specified to determine the intensive state of the substance. Any two, from among
P, V, and T, can be selected as the specified, or independent, variables, and the third can
then be regarded as a function of those two. Thus, the relationship among P, V, and T for a
pure substance can be represented as a surface in three dimensions. PT and PV diagrams like
those illustrated in Figs. 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 represent slices or projections of the three-dimensional
PVT surface. Fig. 3.4 presents a view of the PVT surface for carbon dioxide over a region
including liquid, vapor, and supercritical fluid states. Isotherms are superimposed on this

Single-Phase Regions
For the regions of the diagram where a single phase exists, there is a unique relation connecting P, V, and T. Expressed analytically, as f (P, V, T) = 0, such a relation is known as a PVT
equation of state. It relates pressure, molar or specific volume, and temperature for a pure
homogeneous fluid at equilibrium. The simplest example, the equation for the ideal-gas state,
PV = RT, has approximate validity for the low-pressure gas region and is discussed in detail
in the following section.
An equation of state may be solved for any one of the three quantities P, V, or T, given
values for other two. For example, if V is considered a function of T and P, then V = V(T, P), and

(3.5)

The isotherms for the liquid phase on the left side of Fig. 3.2(b) are very steep and closely
spaced. Thus both ​(​∂ V / ∂ T​)​P​and ​(​∂ V / ∂ P​)​T​​ are small. Hence, both β and κ are small. This characteristic behavior of liquids (outside the critical region) suggests an idealization, commonly
employed in fluid mechanics and known as the incompressible fluid, for which both β and κ
are zero. No real fluid is truly incompressible, but the idealization is useful, because it provides a sufficiently realistic model of liquid behavior for many practical purposes. No equation
of state exists for an incompressible fluid, because V is independent of T and P.
For liquids, β is almost always positive (liquid water between 0°C and 4°C is an exception), and κ is necessarily positive. At conditions not close to the critical point, β and κ are
weak functions of temperature and pressure. Thus for small changes in T and P little error is
introduced if they are assumed constant. Integration of Eq. (3.5) then yields:

This is a less restrictive approximation than the assumption of an incompressible fluid.

​V​1​
Then,
	​ΔV = ​V​2​− ​V​1​= 1.249 − 1.287 = −0.038 ​cm​​3​⋅g​​−1​​	
The preceding example illustrates the fact that heating a liquid that completely fills a closed
vessel can cause a substantial rise in pressure. On the other hand, liquid volume decreases very
slowly with rising pressure. Thus, the very high pressure generated by heating a subcooled
liquid at constant volume can be relieved by a very small volume increase, or a very small leak
in the constant volume container.

3.3

IDEAL GAS AND IDEAL-GAS STATE

In the 19th century, scientists developed a rough experimental knowledge of the PVT behavior
of gases at moderate conditions of temperature and pressure, leading to the equation PV = RT,
wherein V is molar volume and R is a universal constant. This equation adequately describes
PVT behavior of gases for many practical purposes near ambient conditions of T and P. However, more precise measurements show that for pressures appreciably above, and temperatures
appreciably below, ambient conditions, deviations become pronounced. On the other hand,
deviations become ever smaller as pressure decreases and temperature increases.
The equation PV = RT is now understood to define an ideal gas and to represent a model
of behavior more or less approximating the behavior of real gases. It is called the ideal gas
law, but is in fact valid only for pressures approaching zero and temperatures approaching

78

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

infinity. Thus, it is a law only at limiting conditions. As these limits are approached, the molecules making up a gas become more and more widely separated, and the volume of the molecules themselves becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of the total volume occupied by the
gas. Furthermore, the forces of attraction between molecules become ever smaller because
of the increasing distances between them. In the zero-pressure limit, molecules are separated
by infinite distances. Their volumes become negligible compared with the total volume of
the gas, and the intermolecular forces approach zero. The ideal gas concept extrapolates this
behavior to all conditions of temperature and pressure.
The internal energy of a real gas depends on both pressure and temperature. Pressure
dependence results from intermolecular forces. If such forces did not exist, no energy would
be required to alter intermolecular distances, and no energy would be required to bring about
pressure and volume changes in a gas at constant temperature. Thus, in the absence of intermolecular forces, internal energy would depend on temperature only.
These observations are the basis for the concept of a hypothetical state of matter
designated the ideal-gas state. It is the state of a gas comprised of real molecules that have
negligible molecular volume and no intermolecular forces at all temperatures and pressures.
Although related to the ideal gas, it presents a different perspective. It is not the gas that is
ideal, but the state, and this has practical advantages. Two equations are fundamental to this
state, namely the “ideal-gas law” and an expression showing that internal energy depends on
temperature alone:
∙ The equation of state:
	​
​P​V​ig​= RT​​	

(3.7)

∙ Internal energy:
	​
​U​ig​= U​(​T​)​​	

(3.8)

The superscript ig denotes properties for the ideal-gas state.
The property relations for this state are very simple, and at appropriate conditions of T
and P they may serve as suitable approximations for direct application to the real-gas state.
However, they have far greater importance as part of a general three-step procedure for calculation of property changes for real gases that includes a major step in the ideal-gas state. The
three steps are as follows:
1. Evaluate property changes for the mathematical transformation of an initial real-gas
state into the ideal-gas state at the same T and P.
2. Calculate property changes in the ideal-gas state for the T and P changes of the process.
3. Evaluate property changes for the mathematical transformation of the ideal-gas state
back to the real-gas state at the final T and P.
This procedure calculates the primary property-value changes resulting from T and P
changes by simple, but exact, equations for the ideal-gas state. The property-value changes for
transitions between real and ideal-gas states are usually relatively minor corrections. These
transition calculations are treated in Chapter 6. Here, we develop property-value calculations
for the ideal-gas state.

3.3. Ideal Gas and Ideal-Gas State

The defining equation for enthalpy, Eq. (2.10), applied to the ideal-gas state, leads to the

This equation does not mean that ​C​P​​ and ​C​V​​ are themselves constant for the ideal-gas state,
but only that they vary with temperature in such a way that their difference is equal to R. For
any change in the ideal-gas state, Eqs. (3.9) and (3.11) lead to:

(3.14a) ​Δ​H​ig​= ​ ​  ​C​P​  ​dT ​​  (3.14b)
∫
ig

Because both ​U​ig​and ​C​V​​for the ideal-gas state are functions of temperature only, ​Δ​U​ig​​
for the ideal-gas state is always given by Eq. (3.13b), regardless of the kind of process causing
the change. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.5, which shows a graph of internal energy as a function
of ​V​ig​at two different temperatures.
The dashed line connecting points a and b represents a constant-volume process for which
the temperature increases from T1 to T2 and the internal energy changes by Δ
​ ​U​ig​= ​U​  2ig​  ​− ​U​  1ig​  ​​.
ig
This change in internal energy is given by Eq. (3.13b) as Δ
​ ​U​ig​= ∫​C​V​  ​dT​. The dashed lines
connecting points a and c and points a and d represent other processes not occurring at constant
volume but which also lead from an initial temperature T1 to a final temperature T2. The graph
shows that the change in ​U​ig​for these processes is the same as for the constant-volume process,
ig
and it is therefore given by the same equation, namely, ​Δ​U​ig​= ∫​C​V​​dT​. However, ​Δ​U​ig​​ is not
equal to Q for these processes, because Q depends not only on T1 and T2 but also on the path of
the process. An entirely analogous discussion applies to the enthalpy ​H​ig​in the ideal-gas state.

Process Calculations for the Ideal-Gas State
Process calculations provide work and heat quantities. The work of a mechanically reversible
closed-system process is given by Eq. (1.3), here written:
	​
dW = −P d​V​ig​​	

(1.3)

For the ideal-gas state in any closed-system process, the first law as given by Eq. (2.6) written
for a unit mass or a mole, may be combined with Eq. (3.13a) to give:
ig

	​
dQ + dW = ​C​V​ ​dT​	
Substitution for dW by Eq. (1.3) and solution for dQ yields an equation valid for the ideal-gas
state in any mechanically reversible closed-system process:
ig

	​
dQ = ​C​V​​dT + Pd​V​ig​​	

(3.15)

This equation contains the variables P, Vig, and T, only two of which are independent.
Working equations for dQ and dW depend on which pair of these variables is selected as
­independent; i.e., upon which variable is eliminated by Eq. (3.7). We consider two cases,
­eliminating first P, and second, Vig. With ​P = RT / ​V​ig​, Eqs. (3.15) and (1.3) become:

When applied to real gases, Eqs. (3.23) through (3.27) often yield satisfactory approximations, provided the deviations from ideality are relatively small. For monatomic gases, γ =
1.67; approximate values of γ are 1.4 for diatomic gases and 1.3 for simple polyatomic gases
such as CO2, SO2, NH3, and CH4.

Irreversible Processes
All equations developed in this section have been derived for mechanically reversible,
closed-system processes for the ideal-gas state. However, the equations for property changes—
dUig, dHig, ΔUig, and ΔHig—are valid for the ideal-gas state regardless of the process. They
apply equally to reversible and irreversible processes in both closed and open systems, because
changes in properties depend only on initial and final states of the system. On the other hand,
an equation for Q or W, unless it is equal to a property change, is subject to the restrictions of
its derivation.
The work of an irreversible process is usually calculated by a two-step procedure.
First, W is determined for a mechanically reversible process that accomplishes the same
change of state as the actual irreversible process. Second, this result is multiplied or divided
by an efficiency to give the actual work. If the process produces work, the absolute value
for the reversible process is larger than the value for the actual irreversible process and must
be multiplied by an efficiency. If the process requires work, the value for the reversible
process is smaller than the value for the actual irreversible process and must be divided by
an efficiency.
Applications of the concepts and equations of this section are illustrated in the examples
that follow. In particular, the work of irreversible processes is treated in Ex. 3.5.

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

Example 3.3
Air is compressed from an initial state of 1 bar and 298.15 K to a final state of 3 bar
and 298.15 K by three different mechanically reversible processes in a closed system:
(a) Heating at constant volume followed by cooling at constant pressure.
(b) Isothermal compression.
(c) Adiabatic compression followed by cooling at constant volume.
These processes are shown in the figure. We assume air to be in its ideal-gas state,

Choose the system as 1 mol of air. The initial and final states of the air are identical with those of Ex. 2.7. The molar volumes given there are
	​
​V​1ig​ ​= 0.02479​m​​3​ ​ ​V​2ig​ ​= 0.008263 ​m​3​​	
Because T is the same at the beginning and end of the process, in all cases,
	​Δ​U​ig​= Δ​H​ig​= 0​	
(a) The process here is exactly that of Ex. 2.7(b), for which:
	​
​Q = −4958 J​ and​ W = 4958 J​​	
(b) Equation (3.20) for isothermal compression applies. The appropriate value of

For the constant-volume step, no work is done; the heat transfer is:

	​
Q = Δ​U​ig​= ​C​V​​(​T​2​− ​T′​  ​​​​)​​  = 20.785​​(​298.15 − 462.69​)​= −3420 J​	
Thus for process (c),
	​
​W = 3420 J​ and​ Q = −3420 J​​	
Although the property changes ΔUig and ΔHig are zero for each process, Q and
W are path-dependent, and here Q = −W. The figure shows each process on a PVig
diagram. Because the work for each of these mechanically reversible processes is
given by ​W = −∫ Pd​V​​ig​, the work for each process is proportional to the total area
below the paths on the PVig diagram from 1 to 2. The relative sizes of these areas
correspond to the numerical values of W.

Example 3.4
A gas in its ideal-gas state undergoes the following sequence of mechanically
­reversible processes in a closed system:
(a) From an initial state of 70°C and 1 bar, it is compressed adiabatically to 150°C.
(b) It is then cooled from 150 to 70°C at constant pressure.
(c) Finally, it expands isothermally to its original state.
Calculate W, Q, ΔUig, and ΔHig for each of the three processes and for the entire cycle.

The property changes ΔUig and ΔHig both are zero for the entire cycle because
the initial and final states are identical. Note also that Q = −W for the cycle. This
follows from the first law with ΔUig = 0.

Example 3.5
If the processes of Ex. 3.4 are carried out irreversibly but so as to accomplish exactly the
same changes of state—the same changes in P, T, Uig, and Hig—then different values of
Q and W result. Calculate Q and W if each step is carried out with a work efficiency of 80%.

Solution 3.5
If the same changes of state as in Ex. 3.4 are carried out by irreversible processes,
the property changes for the steps are identical with those of Ex. 3.4. However, the
values of Q and W change.

87

3.3. Ideal Gas and Ideal-Gas State
(a) For mechanically reversible, adiabatic compression, the work is Wrev = 998 J.
If the process is 80% efficient compared with this, the actual work is larger, and
W = 998/0.80 = 1248 J. This step cannot here be adiabatic. By the first law,
	​
Q = Δ​U​ig​− W = 998 − 1248 = −250 J​	
(b) The work required for the mechanically reversible cooling process is 665 J. For
the irreversible process, W = 665/0.80 = 831 J. From Ex. 3.4(b), ΔUig = −998 J, and
	​
Q = Δ​U​ig​− W = −998 − 831 = −1829 J​	
(c) As work is done by the system in this step, the irreversible work in absolute
value is less than the reversible work of −1495 J, and the actual work done is:
W = ​(​0.80​)​(​−1495​)​= −1196 J
	​
​   
​ ​​	
Q = Δ​U​ig​− W = 0 + 1196 = 1196 J
For the entire cycle, ΔUig and ΔHig are zero, with
Q = −250 − 1829 + 1196 = −883 J
	​
   
​
​​	
W = 1248 + 831 − 1196 = 883 J
A summary of these results and those for Ex. 3.4 is given in the following table;
values are in joules.

The cycle is one which requires work and produces an equal amount of heat.
The striking feature of the comparison shown in the table is that the total work
required when the cycle consists of three irreversible steps is more than five times
the total work required when the steps are mechanically reversible, even though
each irreversible step is assumed to be 80% efficient.

Example 3.6
Air flows at a steady rate through a horizontal pipe to a partly closed valve. The pipe
leaving the valve is enough larger than the entrance pipe that the kinetic-energy
change of the air as it flows through the valve is negligible. The valve and connecting
pipes are well insulated. The conditions of the air upstream from the valve are 20°C
and 6 bar, and the downstream pressure is 3 bar. If the air is in its ideal-gas state, what
is the temperature of the air some distance downstream from the valve?

88

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

Solution 3.6
Flow through a partly closed valve is known as a throttling process. The system
is insulated, making Q negligible; moreover, the potential-energy and kinetic-­
energy changes are negligible. No shaft work is accomplished, and Ws = 0. Hence,
Eq. (2.31) reduces to:
ig
ig
​Δ​H​ig​= ​H2​ ​ ​− ​H1​ ​ ​= 0​. Because Hig is a function of temperature only, this
requires that T 2 = T 1 . The result that ΔH ig = 0 is general for a throttling
process, because the assumptions of negligible heat transfer and potential- and kinetic-­
energy changes are usually valid. For a fluid in its ideal-gas state, no ­temperature
change occurs. The throttling process is inherently irreversible, but this is immaterial to
the ­calculation because Eq. (3.14b) is valid for the ideal-gas state whatever the process.5

Example 3.7
If in Ex. 3.6 the flow rate of air is 1 mol·s–1 and if both upstream and downstream
pipes have an inner diameter of 5 cm, what is the kinetic-energy change of the air and
ig
what is its temperature change? For air, ​C​P​​= 29.100 J·​mol​​−1​ and the molar mass is
ℳ = 29 g·mol−1.

Clearly, the assumption of negligible temperature change across the valve is justified. Even for an upstream pressure of 10 bar and a downstream pressure of 1 bar
and for the same flow rate, the temperature change is only −0.076 K. We conclude
that, except for very unusual conditions, ΔHig = 0 is a satisfactory energy balance.

VIRIAL EQUATIONS OF STATE

Volumetric data for fluids are useful for many purposes, from the metering of fluids to the
sizing of tanks. Data for V as a function of T and P can of course be given as tables. However,
expression of the functional relation f(P, V, T) = 0 by equations is much more compact and
convenient. The virial equations of state for gases are uniquely suited to this purpose.
Isotherms for gases and vapors, lying to the right of the saturated-vapor curve CD in
Fig. 3.2(b), are relatively simple curves for which V decreases as P increases. Here, the ­product
PV for a given T varies much more slowly than either of its members, and hence is more easily
represented analytically as a function of P. This suggests expressing PV for an isotherm by a
power series in P:
	​
PV = a + bP + c​P​2​+ . . .​	
If we define, b ≡ aB′ , c ≡ aC′, etc., then,
	​
PV = a​​(​1 + B′P + C′​P​2​+ D′​P​3​+ . . .​)​​	
where B′, C′, etc., are constants for a given temperature and a given substance.

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

Ideal-Gas Temperature; Universal Gas Constant
Parameters B′, C′, etc., in Eq. (3.28) are species-dependent functions of temperature, but parameter a is found by experiment to be the same function of temperature for all chemical species.
This is shown by isothermal measurements of V as a function of P for various gases. Extrapolations of the PV product to zero pressure, where Eq. (3.28) reduces to PV = a, show that a is the
same function of T for all gases. Denoting this zero-pressure limit by an asterisk provides:
	​
​(​PV​)​*​= a = f ​(​T​)​​	
This property of gases serves as a basis for an absolute temperature scale. It is defined by arbitrary assignment of the functional relationship f (T) and the assignment of a specific value to
a single point on the scale. The simplest procedure, the one adopted internationally to define
the Kelvin scale (Sec. 1.4):
∙ Makes (PV)* directly proportional to T, with R as the proportionality constant:
	​
​(​PV​)​*​= a ≡ RT​	

(3.29)

∙ Assigns the value 273.16 K to the temperature of the triple point of water (denoted by
subscript t):
	​​​(​PV​)​​  *t​  ​  = R × 273.16 K​	

(3.30)

Division of Eq. (3.29) by Eq. (3.30) gives:
(​ ​PV​)​*​
	​
T  K = 273.16​ ______* ​​	
​(PV)​  t​  ​

(3.31)

This equation provides the experimental basis for the ideal-gas temperature scale throughout
the temperature range for which values of (PV)* are experimentally accessible. The Kelvin
temperature scale is defined so as to be in as close agreement as possible with this scale.
The proportionality constant R in Eqs. (3.29) and (3.30) is the universal gas constant. Its
numerical value is found from Eq. (3.30):

3.4. Virial Equations of State

This dimensionless ratio is called the compressibility factor. It is a measure of the deviation of
the real-gas molar volume from its ideal-gas value. For the ideal-gas state, Z = 1. At ­moderate
temperatures its value is usually <1, though at elevated temperatures it may be >1. Figure 3.6
shows the compressibility factor of carbon dioxide as a function of T and P. This figure presents the
same information as Fig. 3.4, except that it is plotted in terms of Z rather than V. It shows that at low
pressure, Z approaches 1, and at moderate pressures, Z decreases roughly linearly with pressure.

are functions of temperature only.

To derive these relations, we set Z = PV/RT in Eq. (3.34) and solve for P. This allows elimination of P on the right side of Eq. (3.33). The resulting equation reduces to a power series in 1/V
which may be compared term by term with Eq. (3.34) to yield the given relations. They hold
exactly only for the two virial expansions as infinite series, but they are acceptable approximations for the truncated forms used in practice.
Many other equations of state have been proposed for gases, but the virial equations
are the only ones firmly based on statistical mechanics, which provides physical significance
to the virial coefficients. Thus, for the expansion in 1/V, the term B/V arises on account of
interactions between pairs of molecules; the C/V2 term, on account of three-body ­interactions;
etc. Because, at gas-like densities, two-body interactions are many times more common
than three-body interactions, and three-body interactions are many times more numerous
than four-body interactions, the contributions to Z of the successively higher-ordered terms
decrease rapidly.

3.5

APPLICATION OF THE VIRIAL EQUATIONS

The two forms of the virial expansion given by Eqs. (3.33) and (3.34) are infinite series. For
engineering purposes their use is practical only where convergence is very rapid, that is, where
two or three terms suffice for reasonably close approximations to the values of the series. This
is realized for gases and vapors at low to moderate pressures.
Figure 3.7 shows a compressibility-factor graph for methane. All isotherms originate at
Z = 1 and P = 0, and are nearly straight lines at low pressures. Thus the tangent to an isotherm
at P = 0 is a good approximation of the isotherm from P → 0 to some finite pressure. Differentiation of Eq. (3.33) for a given temperature gives:

Thus the equation of the tangent line is Z = 1 + B′P, a result also given by truncating

However, Eq. (3.36) is more convenient in application and is normally at least as accurate as
Eq. (3.37). Thus when the virial equation is truncated to two terms, Eq. (3.36) is preferred.
The second virial coefficient B is substance dependent and a function of temperature.
Experimental values are available for a number of gases.8 Moreover, estimation of second
virial coefficients is possible where no data are available, as discussed in Sec. 3.7.
For pressures above the range of applicability of Eq. (3.36) but below the critical pressure, the virial equation truncated to three terms often provides excellent results. In this case
Eq. (3.34), the expansion in 1/V, is far superior to Eq. (3.33). Thus when the virial equation is
truncated to three terms, the appropriate form is:

This equation is explicit in pressure but is cubic in volume. Analytic solution for V is possible,
but solution by an iterative scheme, as illustrated in Ex. 3.8, is often more convenient.
Values of C, like those of B, depend on the gas and on temperature. Much less is known
about third virial coefficients than about second virial coefficients, though data for a number of gases are found in the literature. Because virial coefficients beyond the third are rarely
known and because the virial expansion with more than three terms becomes unwieldy, its use
is uncommon.

Figure 3.8 illustrates the effect of temperature on the virial coefficients B and C for
nitrogen; although numerical values are different for other gases, the trends are similar. The
curve of Fig. 3.8 suggests that B increases monotonically with T; however, at temperatures
much higher than shown, B reaches a maximum and then slowly decreases. The temperature
dependence of C is more difficult to establish experimentally, but its main features are clear: C
is negative at low temperatures, passes through a maximum at a temperature near the critical
temperature, and thereafter decreases slowly with increasing T.

CUBIC EQUATIONS OF STATE

If an equation of state is to represent the PVT behavior of both liquids and vapors, it must
encompass a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and molar volumes. Yet it must not be
so complex as to present excessive numerical or analytical difficulties in application. Polynomial equations that are cubic in molar volume offer a compromise between generality and
simplicity that is suitable to many purposes. Cubic equations are in fact the simplest equations
capable of representing both liquid and vapor behavior.

The van der Waals Equation of State
The first practical cubic equation of state was proposed by J. D. van der Waals9 in 1873:
RT
a
	​
​P = _
​
​− _
​ ​​	
V − b ​V​2​

(3.39)

Here, a and b are positive constants, specific to a particular species; when they are zero,
the equation for the ideal-gas state is recovered. The purpose of the term a/V2 is to account for
the attractive forces between molecules, which make the pressure lower than that which would
be exerted in the ideal-gas state. The purpose of constant b is to account for the finite size of
molecules, which makes the volume larger than in the ideal-gas state.
Given values of a and b for a particular fluid, one can calculate P as a function of V
for various values of T. Figure 3.9 is a schematic PV diagram showing three such isotherms.

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

Superimposed is the “dome” representing states of saturated liquid and saturated vapor.10 For
the isotherm T1 > Tc, pressure decreases with increasing molar volume. The critical i­sotherm
(labeled Tc) contains the horizontal inflection at C characteristic of the critical point. For the
isotherm T2 < Tc, the pressure decreases rapidly in the subcooled-liquid region with i­ ncreasing
V; after crossing the saturated-liquid line, it goes through a minimum, rises to a maximum,
and then decreases, crossing the saturated-vapor line and continuing downward into the
­superheated-vapor region.

Experimental isotherms do not exhibit the smooth transition from saturated liquid to
saturated vapor characteristic of equations of state; rather, they contain a horizontal segment
within the two-phase region where saturated liquid and saturated vapor coexist in varying
proportions at the saturation (or vapor) pressure. This behavior, shown by the dashed line in
Fig. 3.9, cannot be represented by an equation of state, and we accept as inevitable the
­unrealistic behavior of equations of state in the two-phase region.
Actually, the PV behavior predicted in the two-phase region by proper cubic equations
of state is not wholly fictitious. If pressure is decreased on a saturated liquid devoid of vapor
nucleation sites in a carefully controlled experiment, vaporization does not occur, and liquid
persists alone to pressures well below its vapor pressure. Similarly, raising the pressure on
a saturated vapor in a suitable experiment does not cause condensation, and vapor persists
10Though far from obvious, the equation of state also provides the basis for calculation of the saturated liquid- and
vapor-phase volumes that determine the location of the “dome.” This is explained in Sec. 13.7.

alone to pressures well above the vapor pressure. These nonequilibrium or metastable states
of superheated liquid and subcooled vapor are approximated by those portions of the PV
isotherm which lie in the two-phase region adjacent to the states of saturated liquid and
saturated vapor.11
Cubic equations of state have three volume roots, of which two may be complex.
­Physically meaningful values of V are always real, positive, and greater than constant b. For
an isotherm at T > Tc, reference to Fig. 3.9 shows that solution for V at any value of P yields
only one such root. For the critical isotherm (T = Tc), this is also true, except at the critical
pressure, where there are three roots, all equal to Vc. For isotherms at T < Tc, the equation
may exhibit one or three real roots, depending on the pressure. Although these roots are real
and positive, they are not physically stable states for the portion of an isotherm lying between
saturated liquid and saturated vapor (under the “dome”). Only for the saturation pressure Psat
are the roots, V sat(liq) and V sat(vap), stable states, lying at the ends of the horizontal portion of
the true isotherm. For any pressure other than P sat, there is only a single physically meaningful
root, corresponding to either a liquid or a vapor molar volume.

A Generic Cubic Equation of State
A mid-20th-century development of cubic equations of state was initiated in 1949 by publication of the Redlich/Kwong (RK) equation:12
RT
a​(​ ​T)​ ​
	​
P = ____
​
​− ______
​
​​	
V − b V​​(​V + b​)​

(3.40)

Subsequent enhancements have produced an important class of equations, represented by a
generic cubic equation of state:
RT
a​(​ ​T)​ ​
	​
​P = _
​
​− ___________
​  ​​	
V − b ​(​V + εb​)​(​V + σb​)​

(3.41)

The assignment of appropriate parameters leads not only to the van der Waals (vdW)
equation and the Redlich/Kwong (RK) equation, but also to the Soave/Redlich/Kwong (SRK)13
and the Peng/Robinson (PR) equations.14 For a given equation, ɛ and σ are pure numbers, the
same for all substances, whereas parameters a(T) and b are substance dependent. The temperature dependence of a(T) is specific to each equation of state. The SRK equation is identical to
the RK equation, except for the T dependence of a(T). The PR equation takes different values
for ɛ and σ, as indicated in Table 3.1.
11The heating of liquids in a microwave oven can lead to a dangerous condition of superheated liquid, which can
“flash” explosively.

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

Determination of Equation-of-State Parameters
The parameters b and a(T) of Eq. (3.41) can in principle be found from PVT data, but sufficient data are rarely available. They are in fact usually found from values for the critical
constants Tc and Pc. Because the critical isotherm exhibits a horizontal inflection at the critical
point, we may impose the mathematical conditions:
∂P
​​​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​  = 0​ 
(∂V)
T;cr

​∂​2​P
​​  2 ​​ ​​  ​​  = 0​ 
(3.42) ​​​ ____
( ∂ ​V​ ​)

(3.43)​​ ​ ​​​

T;cr

Subscript “cr” denotes the critical point. Differentiation of Eq. (3.41) yields
e­ xpressions for both derivatives, which may be equated to zero for P = Pc, T = Tc, and V =
Vc. The equation of state may itself be written for the critical conditions. These three equations contain five constants: Pc, Vc, Tc, a(Tc), and b. Of the several ways to treat these equations, the most suitable is elimination of Vc to yield expressions relating a(Tc) and b to Pc
and Tc. The reason is that Pc and Tc are more widely available and more accurately known
than Vc.
The algebra is intricate, but it leads eventually to the following expressions for parameters b and a(Tc):
R​Tc​ ​
	​
​b = Ω​_​​	
​Pc​ ​

(3.44)

and
​R​2​Tc​2​​
	​
a​(​Tc​ ​)​= Ψ​_____
​​	
​Pc​ ​
This result is extended to temperatures other than Tc by the introduction of a dimensionless
function α(Tr; ω) that becomes unity at the critical temperature:
α​​(​Tr​​; ω​)​R​2​T​2​​
	​
​a​(​T​)​= Ψ​___________
  c ​​	
​Pc​ ​

(3.45)

In these equations Ω and Ψ are pure numbers, independent of substance but specific to
a particular equation of state. Function α(Tr; ω) is an empirical expression, wherein by definition Tr ≡ T/Tc, and ω is a parameter specific to a given chemical species, defined and discussed
further below.
This analysis also shows that each equation of state implies a value of the critical compressibility factor Zc that is the same for all substances. Different values are found for different equations. Unfortunately, Zc values calculated from experimental values of Tc, Pc, and Vc
differ from one species to another, and they agree in general with none of the fixed values
predicted by common cubic equations of state. Experimental values are almost all smaller than
any of the predicted values.

3.6. Cubic Equations of State

99

Roots of the Generic Cubic Equation of State
Equations of state are commonly transformed into expressions for the compressibility factor.
An equation for Z equivalent to Eq. (3.41) is obtained by substituting V = ZRT/P. In addition,
we define two dimensionless quantities that lead to simplification:
bP
a​(​ T
​ )​ ​
β
​ ≡ ___
​ ​ ​ (3.46) q​ ≡ ____
​
​ ​ (3.47)
RT
bRT
With these substitutions, Eq. (3.41) assumes the dimensionless form:
Z−β
	​
Z = 1 + β − qβ​__________
  ​​	
(​ ​Z + εβ​)(​ ​Z + σβ​)​

(3.48)

Although the three roots of this equation may be found analytically, they are usually
calculated by iterative procedures built into mathematical software packages. Convergence
problems are most likely avoided when the equation is arranged to a form suited to the solution
for a particular root.
Equation (3.48) is particularly adapted to solving for vapor and vapor-like roots. Iterative solution starts with the value Z = 1 substituted on the right side. The calculated value of
Z is returned to the right side and the process continues to convergence. The final value of Z
yields the volume root through V = ZRT/P = ZVig.
An alternative equation for Z is obtained when Eq. (3.48) is solved for the Z in the
numerator of the final fraction, yielding:
1+β−Z
	​
Z = β + ​(​Z + εβ​)​(​Z + σβ​)​ _
​
​ ​​	
(
qβ )

(3.49)

This equation is particularly suited to solving for liquid and liquid-like roots. Iterative
solution starts with the value Z = β substituted on the right side. Once Z is known, the volume
root is again V = ZRT/P = ZVig.
Experimental compressibility-factor data show that values of Z for different fluids
exhibit similar behavior when correlated as a function of reduced temperature Tr and reduced
pressure Pr, where by definition Tr ≡ T/Tc and Pr ≡ P/Pc. It is therefore common to evaluate equation-of-state parameters through these dimensionless variables. Thus, Eq. (3.46) and
Eq. (3.47) in combination with Eq. (3.44) and (3.45) yield:
P
​ r​​
Ψα​(​ T
​ r​;​ ω​)​
β
​ = Ω​__​ ​ (3.50) q​ = _______
​
​ ​ (3.51)
T
​ r​​
Ω​Tr​​
With parameters β and q evaluated by these equations, Z becomes a function of Tr and
Pr and the equation of state is said to be generalized because of its general applicability to all
gases and liquids. The numerical assignments for parameters ε, σ, Ω, and Ψ for the equations
of interest are summarized in Table 3.1. Expressions are also given for α(Tr; ω) for the SRK
and PR equations.

Corresponding States; Acentric Factor
The dimensionless thermodynamic coordinates Tr and Pr provide the basis for the simplest
corresponding-states correlations:
All fluids, when compared at the same reduced temperature and reduced
pressure, have approximately the same compressibility factor, and all
deviate from ideal-gas behavior to about the same degree.
Two-parameter corresponding-states correlations of Z require the use of only two reducing
parameters Tc and Pc. Although these correlations are very nearly exact for the simple fluids
(argon, krypton, and xenon), systematic deviations are observed for more complex fluids.
Appreciable improvement results from the introduction of a third corresponding-states parameter (in addition to Tc and Pc), characteristic of molecular structure. The most popular such
parameter is the acentric factor, ω, introduced by K. S. Pitzer and coworkers.15
15Fully described in K. S. Pitzer, Thermodynamics, 3rd ed., App. 3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1995.

102

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

The acentric factor for a pure chemical species is defined with reference to its vapor
pressure. The logarithm of the vapor pressure of a pure fluid is approximately linear in the
reciprocal of absolute temperature. This linearity can be expressed as
d log ​Pr​​sat​
_________
	​
​
​= S​	
d​​(​1 / ​Tr​​)​
where ​Pr​​sat​is reduced vapor pressure, Tr is reduced temperature, and S is the slope of a plot of​
log​Pr​​sat​vs. 1/Tr . Note that “log” here denotes the base 10 logarithm.
If two-parameter corresponding-states correlations were generally valid, the slope S
would be the same for all pure fluids. This is observed not to be true; within a limited range,
each fluid has its own characteristic value of S, which could in principle serve as a third
­corresponding-states parameter. However, Pitzer noted that all vapor-pressure data for the simple
fluids (Ar, Kr, Xe) lie on the same line when plotted as ​log ​Pr​​sat​vs. 1/Tr and that the line passes
through l​og ​Pr​​sat​= −1.0​ at Tr = 0.7. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.10. Data for other fluids define
other lines whose locations can be fixed relative to the line for the simple fluids (SF) by the difference:
	​
log​P​r​sat​(​SF​)​− log​P​r​sat​​	
The acentric factor is defined as this difference evaluated at Tr = 0.7:
	​
​ω ≡ −1.0 − log​​(​Pr​​sat​)​​Tr​​= 0.7​​	

(3.52)

Therefore ω can be determined for any fluid from Tc , Pc , and a single vapor-pressure
measurement made at Tr = 0.7. Values of ω and the critical constants Tc , Pc , and Vc for a number of substances are listed in App. B.

The definition of ω makes its value zero for argon, krypton, and xenon, and experimental data yield compressibility factors for all three fluids that are correlated by the same curves
when Z is plotted as a function of Tr and Pr. This is the basic premise of three-parameter
­corresponding-states correlations:

103

3.7. Generalized Correlations for Gases
All fluids having the same value of acentric factor, when compared at the
same reduced temperature and reduced pressure, have about the same
compressibility factor, and all deviate from ideal-gas behavior to about
the same degree.

Equations of state that express Z as a function of only Tr and Pr yield ­two-parameter
corresponding-states correlations. The van der Waals and Redlich/Kwong equations are
­examples. The Soave/Redlich/Kwong (SRK) and Peng/Robinson equations, in which the acentric factor enters through function α(Tr; ω) as an additional parameter, yield ­three-parameter
­corresponding-states correlations.

3.7

GENERALIZED CORRELATIONS FOR GASES

Generalized correlations find widespread use. Most popular are correlations of the kind
­developed by Pitzer and coworkers for the compressibility factor Z and for the second virial
coefficient B.16

Pitzer Correlations for the Compressibility Factor
The correlation for Z is:
	​
Z = ​Z​0​+ ω​Z​1​​	

(3.53)

where Z0 and Z1 are functions of both Tr and Pr . When ω = 0, as is the case for the simple fluids,
the second term disappears, and Z0 becomes identical with Z. Thus a generalized correlation
for Z as a function of Tr and Pr based only on data for argon, krypton, and xenon provides the
relationship Z 0 = F 0(Tr , Pr). By itself, this represents a two-parameter corresponding-states
correlation for Z.
Equation (3.53) is a simple linear relation between Z and ω for given values of Tr and
Pr . Experimental data for Z for nonsimple fluids plotted vs. ω at constant Tr and Pr do indeed
yield approximately straight lines, and their slopes provide values for Z1 from which the generalized function Z1 = F1(Tr , Pr) can be constructed.
Of the Pitzer-type correlations available, the one developed by Lee and Kesler17 is the
most widely used. It takes the form of tables that present values of Z 0 and Z1 as functions of
Tr and Pr . These are given in App. D as Tables D.1 through D.4. Use of these tables requires
interpolation, as demonstrated at the beginning of App. E. The nature of the correlation is
indicated by Fig. 3.11, a plot of Z 0 vs. Pr for six isotherms.
Fig. 3.12 shows Z 0 vs. Pr and Tr as a three-dimensional surface with isotherms and isobars superimposed. The saturation curve, where there is a discontinuity in Z, is not precisely
defined in this plot, which is based on the data of Table D.1 and D.3. One should proceed with
caution when applying the Lee/Kesler tables near the saturation curve. Although the tables
contain values for liquid and vapor phases, the boundary between these will in general not be
the same as the saturation curve for a given real substance. The tables should not be used to
predict whether a substance is vapor or liquid at given conditions. Rather, one must know the

table that represent the appropriate phase.
The Lee/Kesler correlation provides reliable results for gases which are nonpolar or only
slightly polar; for these, errors of no more than 2 or 3 percent are typical. When applied to
highly polar gases or to gases that associate, larger errors can be expected.
The quantum gases (e.g., hydrogen, helium, and neon) do not conform to the same
­corresponding-states behavior as do normal fluids. Their treatment by the usual correlations
is sometimes accommodated by use of temperature-dependent effective critical parameters.18

Pitzer Correlations for the Second Virial Coefficient
The tabular nature of the generalized compressibility-factor correlation is a disadvantage, but
the complexity of the functions Z 0 and Z1 precludes their accurate representation by simple
equations. Nonetheless, we can give approximate analytical expression to these functions for
a limited range of pressures. The basis for this is Eq. (3.36), the simplest form of the virial
equation:

The simplest form of the virial equation has validity only at low to moderate pressures
where Z is linear in pressure. The generalized virial-coefficient correlation is therefore useful
only where Z 0 and Z1 are at least approximately linear functions of reduced pressure. Figure 3.13
compares the linear relation of Z 0 to Pr as given by Eqs. (3.60) and (3.61) with values of
Z 0 from the Lee/Kesler compressibility-factor correlation, Tables D.1 and D.3 of App. D.
The two correlations differ by less than 2% in the region above the dashed line of the
figure. For reduced temperatures greater than Tr ≈ 3, there appears to be no limitation on
the pressure. For lower values of Tr the allowable pressure range decreases with decreasing
temperature. A point is reached, however, at Tr ≈ 0.7 where the pressure range is limited by the
saturation pressure.20 This is indicated by the left-most segment of the dashed line. The minor
contributions of Z1 to the correlations are here neglected. In view of the uncertainty associated
with any generalized correlation, deviations of no more than 2% in Z 0 are not significant.
The relative simplicity of the generalized second-virial-coefficient correlation does
much to recommend it. Moreover, temperatures and pressures of many chemical-processing
19These correlations first appeared in 1975 in the third edition of this book, attributed as a personal communication
to M. M. Abbott, who developed them.
20Although the Lee/Kesler tables of Appendix D list values for superheated vapor and subcooled liquid, they do
not provide values at saturation conditions.

operations lie within the region appropriate to the compressibility-factor correlation. Like the
parent correlation, it is most accurate for nonpolar species and least accurate for highly polar
and associating molecules.

Correlations for the Third Virial Coefficient
Accurate data for third virial coefficients are far less common than for second virial coefficients. Nevertheless, generalized correlations for third virial coefficients do appear in the

Eq. (3.63) usually leads to rapid convergence.

reality. Figure 3.14 can serve as a guide.

1480.7 cm3·mol–1. Significantly, the results of parts (b), (c), and (d) are in excellent
agreement. Mutual agreement at these conditions is suggested by Fig. 3.13.

Because the pressure here is high, the generalized compressibility-factor
correlation is the proper choice. In the absence of a known value for Pr , an
iterative procedure is based on the following equation:

or​

Z
​Pr​​= _______

One now assumes a starting value for Z, say Z = 1. This gives Pr = 4.68, and
allows a new value of Z to be calculated by Eq. (3.53) from values interpolated
in Tables D.3 and D.4 at the reduced temperature of Tr = 1.695. With this new
value of Z, a new value of Pr is calculated, and the procedure continues until no
significant change occurs from one step to the next. The final value of Z so found
is 0.894 at Pr = 4.35. This may be confirmed by substitution into Eq. (3.53) of
values for Z0 and Z1 from Tables D.3 and D.4 interpolated at Pr = 4.35 and Tr =
1.695. With ω = 0.012,
Z = ​Z​0​+ ω​Z​1​= 0.891 + ​(​0.012​)​(​0.268​)​= 0.894

Because the acentric factor is small, the two- and three-parameter compressibilityfactor correlations are little different. The Redlich/Kwong equation and the generalized

196.5 bar.

(b) Because the reduced pressure is low (Pr ≈ 27.53/112.8 = 0.244), the generalized virial-coefficient correlation should suffice. Values of B0 and B1 are given by

​B​0​= −0.482​

An iterative solution is not necessary because B is independent of pressure. The c­alculated P corresponds to a reduced pressure of Pr = 23.76/112.8 = 0.211. Reference
to Fig. 3.13 confirms the suitability of the generalized virial-coefficient correlation.
Experimental data indicate that the pressure is 23.82 bar at the given conditions. Thus the ideal-gas state yields an answer high by about 15%, whereas the
virial-coefficient correlation gives an answer in substantial agreement with experiment, even though ammonia is a polar molecule.

GENERALIZED CORRELATIONS FOR LIQUIDS

Although the molar volumes of liquids can be calculated by means of generalized cubic equations of state, the results are often not of high accuracy. However, the Lee/Kesler correlation
includes data for subcooled liquids, and Fig. 3.11 illustrates curves for both liquids and gases.
Values for both phases are provided in Tables D.1 through D.4 of App. D. Recall, however,
that this correlation is most suitable for nonpolar and slightly polar fluids.
In addition, generalized equations are available for the estimation of molar volumes of
saturated liquids. The simplest equation, proposed by Rackett,22 is an example:
2/7

	​
​V​sat​= ​Vc​ ​​​Zc​  ​​​​  ​(1​ −T​ r​​)​​  ​​​

3.8. Generalized Correlations for Liquids

The only data required are the critical constants, given in Table B.1 of App. B. Results are
usually accurate to 1 or 2%.
Lydersen, Greenkorn, and Hougen23 developed a two-parameter corresponding-states
correlation for estimation of liquid volumes. It provides a correlation of reduced density ρr as
a function of reduced temperature and pressure. By definition,

where ρc is the density at the critical point. The generalized correlation is shown by Fig. 3.15.
This figure may be used directly with Eq. (3.70) for determination of liquid volumes if the
value of the critical volume is known. A better procedure is to make use of a single known
liquid volume (state 1) by the identity,

CHAPTER 3. Volumetric Properties of Pure Fluids

This method gives good results and requires only experimental data that are usually available.
Figure 3.15 makes clear the increasing effects of both temperature and pressure on liquid density as the critical point is approached.
Correlations for the molar densities as functions of temperature are given for many pure
liquids by Daubert and coworkers.24

Example 3.13
For ammonia at 310 K, estimate the density of:
(a) The saturated liquid;
(b) The liquid at 100 bar.

(a) Apply the Rackett equation at the reduced temperature,  ​​Tr​​= 310/405.7 = 0.7641​.

If we start with the experimental value of 29.14 cm3·mol–1 for saturated liquid
at 310 K, Eq. (3.71) may be used. For the saturated liquid at ​Tr​​= 0.764,​ρ​​r​1​​ = 2.34​

Heat Effects

Heat effects refer to physical and chemical phenomena that are associated with heat transfer to
or from a system or that result in temperature changes within a system, or both. The simplest
example of a heat effect is the heating or cooling of a fluid by the purely physical direct transfer
of heat to or from the fluid. The temperature changes that occur are known as sensible heat
effects, because they may be detected by our sense perception of temperature. Phase changes,
physical processes occurring for a pure substance at constant temperature and pressure, are
accompanied by latent heats. Chemical reactions are characterized by heats of reaction, which
for combustion reactions evolve heat. Every chemical or biochemical process is associated with
one or more heat effects. The metabolism of the human body, for example, generates heat which
is either transferred to its surroundings or used to maintain or increase body temperature.
Chemical manufacturing processes may include a number of heat effects. Ethylene
­glycol (a coolant and antifreeze) is made by catalytic partial oxidation of ethylene to form
ethylene oxide, followed by a hydration reaction:
​C​2​​H​4​+ _​  12 ​O2 → ​C​2​​H​4​O

​​​   
C
​2​​H​4​O + ​H​2​O → ​C​2​​H​4​​(OH)​
​ 2​
​​The oxidation reaction is carried out near 250°C, and the reactants must be heated to
this temperature, a sensible heat effect. The oxidation reaction tends to raise the temperature,
and the heat of reaction is removed from the reactor to keep the temperature near 250°C. The
ethylene oxide is hydrated to glycol by absorption in water. Heat is evolved because of the
phase change and dissolution, and also because of the hydration reaction. Finally, the glycol
is purified by distillation, a process of vaporization and condensation, resulting in the separation of glycol from solution. Virtually all of the important heat effects are included in this
process. Most of these are treated in the present chapter, although heat effects related to mixing processes must be delayed until Chap. 11, after thermodynamics of solutions have been
introduced in Chap. 10. The following important heat effects are considered in this chapter:
∙ Sensible heat effects, characterized by temperature changes
∙ Heat capacities as a function of temperature and their use through defined functions
∙ Heats of phase transition, i.e., latent heats of pure substances

4.1

SENSIBLE HEAT EFFECTS

Heat transfer to or from a system in which there are no phase transitions, no chemical reactions, and no changes in composition causes a sensible heat effect, i.e., the temperature of the
system is caused to change. The need here is for a relation between the quantity of heat transferred and the resulting temperature change.
When the system is a homogeneous substance of constant composition, the phase rule
indicates that fixing the values of two intensive properties establishes its state. The molar or
specific internal energy of a substance may therefore be expressed as a function of two other
state variables. The key thermodynamic variable is temperature. With molar or specific volume chosen arbitrarily, we have U = U(T, V). Then
∂U
∂U
​dU = ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dT + ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dV​
( ∂T )
( ∂V )
V
T
With the definition of CV provided by Eq. (2.15) this becomes:
∂U
​dU = ​CV​ ​dT + ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dV​
( ∂V )
T
The final term is zero in two circumstances:
∙ For any closed-system constant-volume process.
∙ Whenever the internal energy is independent of volume, as for the ideal-gas state and the
incompressible liquid.
In either case,	​dU = ​CV​  ​​  dT​
​T​ 2​​

and	​
ΔU = ​ ​  ​​CV​  ​​ dT ​​
∫ ​T​ 1​​

(4.1)

Although real liquids are to some degree compressible, far below their critical temperature they can often be treated as incompressible fluids. The ideal-gas state is also of interest, because actual gases at low pressures approach ideality. The only possible mechanically
reversible constant-volume process is simple heating (stirring work is inherently irreversible),
for which Q = ΔU, and Eq. (2.18) written for a unit mass or a mole becomes:
​T​2​

​Q = ΔU = ​ ​ ​CV​ ​dT​
∫​T​1​

135

4.1. Sensible Heat Effects

The enthalpy may be treated similarly, with molar or specific enthalpy expressed most
conveniently as a function of temperature and pressure. Then H = H(T, P), and
∂H
∂H
​dH = ​​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dT + ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dP​
( ∂T )
( ∂P )
P
T
With the definition of CP provided by Eq. (2.19),
∂H
​dH = ​CP​ ​dT + ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dP​
( ∂P )
T
Again, the final term is zero for two situations:
∙ For any constant-pressure process.
∙ When the enthalpy is independent of pressure, regardless of process. This is exactly true
for the ideal-gas state and approximately true for real gases at low pressure and high
temperature.
In either case,	​dH = ​CP​  ​​ dT​
​T​ 2​​

and		​
ΔH = ​ ​  ​​CP​  ​​ dT ​​
∫ ​T​ 1​​

(4.2)

Moreover, Q = ΔH for mechanically reversible, constant-pressure, closed-system processes
[Eq. (2.22)] and for the transfer of heat in steady-flow processes where ΔEP and ΔEK are

This equation finds frequent application for flow processes designed for simple heating and
cooling of gases, liquids, and solids.

Temperature Dependence of the Heat Capacity
Evaluation of the integral in Eq. (4.3) requires knowledge of the temperature dependence of
the heat capacity. This is usually given by an empirical equation; the two simplest expressions
of practical value are:
​CP​ ​
​___​= α + βT + γ​T​2​
R

and

​CP​ ​
​___​= a + bT + c​T​−2​
R

where α, β, and γ and a, b, and c are constants characteristic of the particular substance. With
the exception of the last term, these equations are of the same form. We therefore combine
them to provide a single expression:
​CP​ ​

	​
​ ​= A + BT + C​T​2​+ D​T​−2​​	
R

(4.4)

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects

where either C or D is usually zero, depending on the substance considered.1 Because the
ratio CP/R is dimensionless, the units of CP are governed by the choice of R. The parameters
are independent of temperature, but, at least in principle, depend on the value of the constant
pressure. However, for liquids and solids the effect of pressure is usually very small. Values
of the constants for selected solids and liquids are given in Tables C.2 and C.3 of App. C. The
heat capacities of solids and liquids are usually found by direct measurement. Correlations for
the heat capacities of many solids and liquids are given by Perry and Green and in the DIPPR
Project 801 collection.2

Heat Capacity in the Ideal-Gas State
We noted in Section 3.3 that as P → 0 a gas approaches the ideal-gas state, wherein molecular
volumes and intermolecular forces are negligible. If these conditions are imagined to persist
with increasing pressure, a hypothetical ideal-gas state continues to exist at finite pressures.
The gas still has properties reflective of its internal molecular configuration, just as does a
real gas, but without the influence of intermolecular interactions. Accordingly, ideal-gas-state
ig
ig
heat capacities, designated by ​​C​P​  ​​ and ​​C​V​  ​​, are functions of temperature, but independent of
pressure, providing for ease of correlation. Fig. 4.1 illustrates the temperature dependence of​​
ig
C​P​  ​​for several representative substances.
Statistical mechanics provides a basic equation for the temperature dependence of the
ideal-gas-state internal energy:

​U​ig​= __
​ ​RT + f (​ T)​

ig
Equation (3.10), for the ideal-gas state, ​H​ ​= ​U​ig​+ RT​, becomes:

The first term on the right represents translational kinetic energy of the molecule, whereas the
second combines all rotational and vibrational kinetic energies associated with the molecule.
Because the molecules of a monatomic gas have no energies of rotation or vibration, f (T) in the
ig
preceding equation is zero. Thus, in Fig. 4.1 the value of C​
​​ P​  ​/ R​for argon is constant at a value
of 5/2. For diatomic and polyatomic gases, f (T) contributes importantly at all temperatures of
practical importance. Diatomic molecules have a contribution equal to RT from their two
ig
­rotational modes of motion. Thus, in Fig. 4.1, C​
​​ P​  ​/ R​for N2 is about 7/2 R at moderate temperature, and it increases at higher temperatures as intramolecular vibration begins to contribute.
Nonlinear polyatomic molecules have a contribution of 3/2 R from their three rotational modes

also includes a T3 term as well as all four terms of Eq. (4.4).

of estimation are employed, as described by Prausnitz, Poling, and O’Connell.4

Temperature dependence is expressed analytically by equations such as Eq. (4.4), here written:

Values of the constants are given in Table C.1 of App. C for a number of common
organic and inorganic gases. More accurate but more complex equations are found in the literature.5 As a result of Eq. (3.12), the two ideal-gas-state heat capacities are related:

The temperature dependence of C​
​​ V​  ​/R​follows from the temperature dependence of C​
​​ P​  ​/R​.
Although ideal-gas-state heat capacities are exactly correct for real gases only at zero
pressure, the departure of real gases from the ideal-gas state is seldom significant at pressures
ig
ig
below several bars, and here C​
​​ P​  ​​ and ​​C​V​  ​​are usually good approximations to their true heat
capacities. Reference to Fig. 3.14 indicates a vast range of conditions at Pr < 0.1 for which
assumption of the ideal-gas state is usually a suitable approximation. For most substances Pc
exceeds 30 bar, which means that ideal-gas state behavior is often closely approximated up to
a pressure of at least 3 bar.

Example 4.1
The parameters listed in Table C.1 of Appendix C require use of Kelvin temperatures
in Eq. (4.5). Equations of the same form may also be developed for use with temperatures in °C, but the parameter values are different. The molar heat capacity of methane
in the ideal-gas state is given as a function of temperature in kelvins by:

4.1. Sensible Heat Effects

Gas mixtures of constant composition behave exactly as do pure gases. In the ideal-gas
state, molecules in mixtures have no influence on one another, and each gas exists independent
of the others. The ideal-gas-state heat capacity of a mixture is therefore the mole-fractionweighted sum of the heat capacities of the individual gases. Thus, for gases A, B, and C, the
molar heat capacity of a mixture in the ideal-gas state is:
ig

(4.7)

where ​​C​​P​A ​,​​  ​C​​P​B ​,​​  and ​C​​P​C ​​​​  are the molar heat capacities of pure A, B, and C in the ideal-gas state,
and yA, yB, and yC are mole fractions. Because the heat-capacity polynomial, Eq. (4.5), is linear in the coefficients, the coefficients A, B, C, and D for a gas mixture are similarly given by
mole-fraction weighted sums of the coefficients for the pure species.

Evaluation of the Sensible-Heat Integral
Evaluation of the integral ∫ CPdT is accomplished by substitution for CP as a function of T
by Eq. (4.4), followed by formal integration. For temperature limits of T0 and T the result is:
T ​C​ ​
B
C
T − ​T​0​

(4.8)

Given T0 and T, the calculation of Q or ΔH is straightforward. Less direct is the calculation of T, given T0 and Q or ΔH. Here, an iteration scheme may be useful. Factoring (T − T0)
from each term on the right side of Eq. (4.8) gives:
T ​C​ ​

	​
​ ​ ​___
​ ​dT = ​​ ​A + _

We identify the quantity in square brackets as ​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​/ R​, where ​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​is defined as a mean heat
capacity for the temperature range from T0 to T:
​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​

(4.9)

Equation (4.2) may therefore be written:
	​
ΔH = ​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​(T − ​T​0​)​	

(4.10)

The angular brackets enclosing CP identify it as a mean value; subscript H denotes a mean
value specific to enthalpy calculations and distinguishes this mean heat capacity from a similar quantity introduced in the next chapter.
Solution of Eq. (4.10) for T gives:
ΔH
	​
T = ________
​
​+ ​T​ ​​	
​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​ 0

(4.11)

With a starting value for T, one can first evaluate ​⟨​​CP​ ​⟩​H​​by Eq. (4.9). Substitution into
Eq. (4.11) provides a new value of T from which to reevaluate ​⟨​CP​ ​⟩​H​. Iteration continues to
convergence on a final value of T. Of course, such iteration is readily automated with built-in
functions in a spreadsheet or a numerical analysis software package.

Use of Defined Functions
The integral ∫ (CP/R)dT appears often in thermodynamic calculations. As a matter of convenience, we therefore define the right side of Eq. (4.8) as the function, ICPH(T0, T; A, B,
C, D), and presume the availability of a computer routine for its evaluation.6 Equation (4.8)
then becomes:
T ​C​ ​
P
​ ​ ​___
​ ​dT ≡ ICPH(​T​0​, T; A, B, C, D)​
∫​T​0​ R

The function name is ICPH (I indicates an integral), and the quantities in parentheses are the
variables T0 and T, followed by parameters A, B, C, and D. When these quantities are assigned
numerical values, the notation represents a value for the integral. Thus, for the evaluation of
Q in Ex. 4.2:
​Q = 8.314 × ICPH(533.15, 873.15; 1.702, 9​.081 × 10​​−3​, −2​.164 × 10​​−6​, 0.0) = 19,778 J​
Also useful is a defined function for the dimensionless mean value ​⟨​​CP​ ⟩​ ​H​/ R​given by
Eq. (4.9). The function name is MCPH (M indicates a mean). The right side defines the function, MCPH(T0, T; A, B, C, D). With this definition, Eq. (4.9) becomes:
​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​
________
​
​= MCPH(​T​ ​, T; A, B, C, D)​

4.2. Latent Heats of Pure Substances
A specific numerical value of this function is:
​MCPH(533.15, 873.15; 1.702, 9​.081×10​​−3​, −2​.164 × 10​​−6​, 0.0) = 6.9965​
representing ​⟨​​CP​ ​⟩​H​/ R​for methane in the calculation of Ex. 4.2. By Eq. (4.10),
	​
​ΔH = ​(​8.314​)​(​6.9965​)​(​873.15 − 533.15​)​= 19,778 J​​

Example 4.3
What is the final temperature when heat in the amount of 400 × 106 J is added to 11 × 103
mol of ammonia initially at 530 K in a steady-flow process at 1 bar?

Solution 4.3
If ΔH is the enthalpy change for 1 mol, Q = n ΔH, and
Q 400 × ​10​​6​
​ΔH = __

​= MCPH​(530, T; 3.578, 3.020 × ​10​​−3​, 0.0, −0.186 × ​10​​5)​ ​​​
R
This equation and Eq. (4.11) together may be solved for T, yielding T = 1234 K.
A trial procedure is an alternative approach to solution of this problem. One
sets up an equation for Q by combining Eqs. (4.3) and (4.8), with T as an unknown
on the right. With Q known, one merely substitutes a rational succession of values
for T until the value of Q is reproduced. Microsoft Excel’s Goal Seek function is
an example of an automated version of this procedure.

4.2

LATENT HEATS OF PURE SUBSTANCES

When a pure substance is liquefied from the solid state or vaporized from the liquid or solid at
constant pressure, no change in temperature occurs; however, these processes require the transfer
of finite amounts of heat to the substance. These heat effects are called latent heats: of fusion, of
vaporization, and of sublimation. Similarly, there are heats of transition accompanying the change
of a substance from one allotropic solid state to another; for example, the heat absorbed when
rhombic crystalline sulfur changes to the monoclinic structure at 95°C and 1 bar is 11.3 J⋅g−1.
The characteristic feature of all these processes is the coexistence of two phases. According to the phase rule, the intensive state of a two-phase system consisting of a single species
is fixed by specification of just one intensive property. Thus the latent heat accompanying a
phase change is a function of temperature only, and is related to other system properties by an
exact thermodynamic equation:
d​P​sat​
	​
​ΔH = TΔV _
​
​​	
dT

(4.12)

142

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects
where for a pure species at temperature T,
ΔH = latent heat = enthalpy change accompanying the phase change
ΔV = volume change accompanying the phase change
Psat = saturation pressure, i.e., the pressure at which the phase change occurs, which is
a function only of T

The derivation of this equation, known as the Clapeyron equation, is given in Section 6.5.
When Eq. (4.12) is applied to the vaporization of a pure liquid, dPsat/dT is the slope
of the vapor pressure-versus-temperature curve at the temperature of interest, ΔV is the difference between molar volumes of saturated vapor and saturated liquid, and ΔH is the latent
heat of vaporization. Thus, ΔH may be calculated from vapor-pressure and volumetric data,
yielding an energy value with units of pressure × volume.
Latent heats are also measured calorimetrically. Experimental values are reported at
selected temperatures for many substances.7 Empirical correlations for the latent heats of
many compounds as a function of temperature are given by Perry and Green and in the DIPPR
Project 801 collection.8 When required data are not available, approximate methods can provide estimates of the heat effect accompanying a phase change. Because heats of vaporization
are by far the most important in practice, they have received the most attention. Predictions are
most often made by group-contribution methods.9 Alternative empirical methods serve one of
two purposes:
∙ Prediction of the heat of vaporization at the normal boiling point, i.e., at a pressure of
1 standard atmosphere, defined as 101,325 Pa.
∙ Estimation of the heat of vaporization at any temperature from the known value at a
single temperature.
Rough estimates of latent heats of vaporization for pure liquids at their normal boiling
points (indicated by subscript n) are given by Trouton’s rule:
Δ​Hn​ ​
____
​
​~ 10​
R​Tn​ ​

where Tn is the absolute temperature of the normal boiling point. The units of ΔHn, R, and Tn
are chosen so that ΔHn/RTn is dimensionless. Dating from 1884, this empirical rule provides
a simple check on whether values calculated by other methods are reasonable. Representative
experimental values for this ratio are Ar, 8.0; N2, 8.7; O2, 9.1; HCl, 10.4; C6H6, 10.5; H2S,
10.6; and H2O, 13.1. The high value for water reflects the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds that rupture during vaporization.

This corresponds to 2334 J⋅g−1; the steam-table value of 2257 J⋅g−1 is lower by 3.4 percent.
Estimates of the latent heat of vaporization of a pure liquid at any temperature from the
known value at a single temperature are given by the method of Watson.11 The basis may be a

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects

STANDARD HEAT OF REACTION

Heat effects of chemical processes are fully as important as those for physical processes. Chemical
reactions are accompanied by the transfer of heat, by temperature changes during reaction,
or by both. The ultimate cause lies in the difference between the molecular configurations of
products and reactants. For an adiabatic combustion reaction, reactants and products possess
the same energy, requiring an elevated temperature for the products. For the corresponding
isothermal reaction, heat is necessarily transferred to the surroundings. Between these two
extremes an infinite combination of effects is possible. Each reaction carried out in a particular way is accompanied by particular heat effects. Their complete tabulation is impossible. Our
object is therefore to devise methods of calculation of the heat effects for reactions carried out
in diverse ways from data for reactions carried out in an arbitrarily defined standard way, thus
leading to standard heats of reaction. This reduces the required data to a minimum.
Heats of reaction are based on experimental measurements. Most easily measured are
heats of combustion, because of the nature of such reactions. A simple procedure is provided
by a flow calorimeter. Fuel is mixed with air at a temperature T, and the mixture flows into a
combustion chamber where reaction occurs. The combustion products enter a water-jacketed
section in which they are cooled to temperature T. Because no shaft work is produced and the
calorimeter is designed to eliminate potential- and kinetic-energy changes, the overall energy
balance, Eq. (2.32), reduces to
​ΔH = Q ​
Thus the enthalpy change caused by the combustion reaction is equal in magnitude to the heat
flowing from the reaction products to the water, and may be calculated from the temperature
rise and flow rate of the water. The enthalpy change of reaction ΔH is called the heat of
reaction. If the reactants and products are in their standard states, then the heat effect is the
standard heat of reaction.
The definition of a standard state is straightforward. For a given temperature,
A standard state is defined as the state of a substance at specified pressure, composition, and physical condition as, e.g., gas, liquid, or solid.
The standard states in use throughout the world have been established by general agreement. They are based on a standard-state pressure of 1 bar (105 Pa). With respect to composition, the standard states used in this chapter are states of pure species. For liquids and solids it
is the actual state of the pure species at the standard-state pressure. Nothing could be simpler.
However, for gases there is a small complication, as the chosen physical state is the ideal-gas
state, for which we have already established heat capacities. In summary, the standard states
used in this chapter are:
∙ Gases: The pure substance in the ideal-gas state at 1 bar.
∙ Liquids and solids: The real pure liquid or solid at 1 bar.
One must understand that standard states apply at any temperature.
There is no specification of temperature for any standard state. Reference temperatures, also in use with heats of reaction, are entirely independent of standard states.

145

4.3. Standard Heat of Reaction

With respect to the chemical reaction, aA + bB → lL + mM, the standard heat of reaction at temperature T is defined as the enthalpy change when a moles of A and b moles of B
in their standard states at temperature T react to form l moles of L and m moles of M in their
standard states at the same temperature T. The mechanism of this change is immaterial to the
calculation of the enthalpy change. One may view the process shown in Fig. 4.2 as occurring
in a “box of tricks.” If the properties of reactants and products in their standard states are not
significantly different from the properties of actual reactants and products, the standard heat
of reaction is a reasonable approximation to the actual heat of reaction. If this is not the case,
then additional steps must be incorporated into the calculation scheme to account for any
differences. The most common difference is caused by pressures higher than appropriate to
the ideal-gas state (as for the ammonia-synthesis reaction). In this case, enthalpy changes for
transformation from real-gas states to ideal-gas states and the reverse are required. These are
readily made, as shown in Chapter 6.

nA = a mol·s-1

nB = b mol·s-1
In standard states, at T

nL = l mol·s -1
nM = m mol·s-1
In standard states, at T

Q J·s-1 = ΔHT° J
Figure 4.2: Schematic representation of the standard heat of reaction at temperature T.

Property values in the standard state are denoted by the degree symbol. For example, ​
​C​P°​​is the standard-state heat capacity. Because the standard state for gases is the
ig
ideal-gas state, ​C​P°​ is identical with ​​C​P​  ​​, and the data of Table C.1 apply to the standard state
for gases.
All conditions for a standard state are fixed except temperature, which
is always the temperature of the system. Standard-state properties are
therefore functions of temperature only.
The standard state chosen for gases is hypothetical or fictitious because at 1 bar actual
gases deviate from the ideal-gas state. However, they seldom deviate much, and for most purposes enthalpies for the real-gas state at 1 bar and the ideal-gas state are negligibly different.
When a heat of reaction is given for a particular reaction, it applies for the stoichiometric
coefficients as written. If each stoichiometric coefficient is doubled, the heat of reaction is
doubled. For example, two versions of the ammonia synthesis reaction are written:

STANDARD HEAT OF FORMATION

Tabulation of data for just one temperature and for just the standard heats of reaction for all
of the vast number of possible reactions is impractical. Fortunately, the standard heat of any
reaction at temperature T can be calculated if the standard heats of formation at the same
temperature are known for the compounds taking part in the reaction. A formation reaction is
defined as a reaction that forms a single compound from its constituent elements. For example,
the reaction ​C + _​12 ​O2 + 2 ​H​2​→ ​CH​3​OH​is a formation reaction for methanol. The reaction
​H​2​O + ​SO​3​→ ​H​2​​SO​4​​ is not a formation reaction, because it forms sulfuric acid not from the
elements but from other compounds. Formation reactions are understood to produce 1 mol of
product; the heat of formation is therefore based on 1 mol of the compound formed.
Heats of reaction at any temperature can be calculated from heat-capacity data if the
value for one temperature is known; the tabulation of data can therefore be reduced to the
compilation of standard heats of formation at a single temperature. The usual choice for this
reference temperature is 298.15 K or 25°C. The standard heat of formation of a compound
at this temperature is represented by the symbol ​
Δ​H​°​f​298​​
.​ The degree symbol denotes
the ­
standard-state value, subscript f identifies a heat of formation, and the 298 is the
rounded absolute temperature in kelvins. Tables of these values for common substances
may be found in standard handbooks, but the most extensive compilations available are in
specialized reference works.12 An abridged list of values is given in Table C.4 of App. C, and
values for many additional compounds are given in publicly available online databases.13
When chemical reactions are combined by addition, the standard heats of reaction may
also be added to give the standard heat of the resulting reaction. This is possible because
enthalpy is a state function, and its changes for given initial and final states are independent of
path. In particular, formation reactions and standard heats of formation may be combined to
produce any desired reaction (not itself a formation reaction) and its accompanying standard
heat of reaction. Reactions written for this purpose often include an indication of the physical
state of each reactant and product—that is, the letter g, l, or s is placed in parentheses after the
chemical formula to show whether it is a gas, a liquid, or a solid. This might seem unnecessary
because a pure chemical species at a particular temperature and 1 bar can usually exist only in
one physical state. However, fictitious states (e.g., the ideal-gas state) are often employed for
convenience in such calculations.
12For example, see TRC Thermodynamic Tables—Hydrocarbons and TRC Thermodynamic Tables—Non-Hydrocarbons,
serial publications of the Thermodynamics Research Center, Texas A & M Univ. System, College Station, Texas;
“The NBS Tables of Chemical Thermodynamic Properties,” J. Physical and Chemical Reference Data, vol. 11,
supp. 2, 1982; and the DIPPR Project 801 Database, http://www.aiche.org/dippr/projects/801. Where data
are ­unavailable, estimates based only on molecular structure may be found by the methods of S. W. Benson,

4.4. Standard Heat of Formation

The water-gas-shift reaction, ​CO​2​(g) + ​H​2​(g)→ CO(g) +​H​2​O(g)​at 25°C, is commonly
encountered in the chemical industry. Although it takes place only at temperatures well above
25°C, the data are for 25°C, and the initial step in any calculation of heat effects for this reaction is evaluation of the standard heat of reaction at 25°C. The pertinent formation reactions
and the corresponding heats of formation from Table C.4 are:
​CO​2​(​g​)​:​

​C​(​s​)​+ ​O​2​(​g​)​→ ​CO​2​(​g​)​

Δ​H​°​f​298​​ = − 393,509 J

​H​2​(g) + _​  12 ​ ​O​2​(g) → ​H​2​O(g)

Δ​H​°​f​298​​ = − 241,818 J

Because the reaction is actually carried out entirely in the gas phase at high temperature, convenience dictates that the standard states of all products and reactants at 25°C be taken as the
ideal-gas state at 1 bar, even though water does not actually exist as a gas at these conditions.14
Writing the formation reactions so that their sum yields the desired reaction requires that
the formation reaction for CO2 be written in reverse; the heat of reaction is then of opposite
sign to its standard heat of formation:
​CO​2​(​g​)​ ​→ C(s​)​+ ​O​2​(​g​)​      

Δ​H​°298​= 393,509 J

C(s) + _​  1 ​ ​O​ ​(g)​ ​  ​→ CO​(​g​)​​  ​

​​
 ​​​
The meaning of this result is that the enthalpy of 1 mol of CO plus 1 mol of H2O is greater
than the enthalpy of 1 mol of CO2 plus 1 mol of H2 by 41,166 J when each product and reactant is taken as the pure gas at 25°C in its ideal-gas state at 1 bar.
In this example the standard heat of formation of H2O is available for its hypothetical
ideal-gas state at 25°C. One might expect the value of the heat of formation of water to be
listed for its actual state as a liquid at 1 bar and 25°C. As a matter of fact, values for both states
are given in Table C.4 because they are both often used. This is true for many compounds that
normally exist as liquids at 25°C and 1 bar. Cases do arise, however, in which a value is given
only for the standard state as a liquid or for the ideal-gas state when what is needed is the other
value. Suppose this were the case for the preceding example, with only the standard heat of
formation of liquid H2O available. We would then include an equation for the physical change
that transforms water from its standard state as a liquid into its ideal-gas state. The enthalpy
change for this physical process is the difference between the heats of formation of water in its
two standard states:
​− 241,818 − ​(​−285,830​)​= 44,012 J​​

14One might wonder about the origin of data for such hypothetical states, as it would appear difficult to make
measurements for states that cannot exist. For the case of water vapor in the ideal gas state at 25˚C and 1 bar, obtaining
the enthalpy is straightforward. While water cannot exist as a gas at these conditions, it is a gas at 25˚C at sufficiently
low pressure. In the ideal gas state, enthalpy is independent of pressure, so the enthalpy measured in the limit of low
pressure is exactly the enthalpy in the desired hypothetical state.

This result is of course in agreement with the previous answer.

Example 4.5
Calculate the standard heat of reaction at 25°C for the following reaction:

Standard heats of formation at 298.15 K from Table C.4 are:
​HCl(g) : − 92,307 J    ​H​2​O(g) : −241,818 J​
The following combination gives the desired result:

​

4.5 STANDARD HEAT OF COMBUSTION
Only a few formation reactions can actually be carried out at the conditions of interest, and therefore data for these reactions are determined indirectly. One kind of reaction that readily lends
itself to experiment is the combustion reaction, and many standard heats of formation come from
standard heats of combustion, measured calorimetrically. A combustion reaction is defined as
a reaction of an element or compound with oxygen to form specified combustion products. For
organic compounds consisting only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the products are carbon
dioxide and water, but the state of the water may be either vapor or liquid. The value for liquid
water product is called the higher heat of combustion, while that with water vapor as product is
the lower heat of combustion. Data are always based on 1 mol of the substance burned.
A reaction such as the formation of n-butane:
​4C(s) +5​H​2​(g) → ​C​4​H​10​(g)​

149

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF ΔH°

In the foregoing sections, standard heats of reaction were discussed for an arbitrary reference
temperature of 298.15 K. In this section we treat the calculation of standard heats of reaction
at other temperatures from knowledge of the value at the reference temperature.
A general chemical reaction may be written:
​|​​ν​1​|​​A​1​+ ​|​​ν​2​|​​A​2​+ . . . → ​|​​ν​3​|​​A​3​+ ​|​​ν​4​|​​A​4​+ . . .​​
where νi is a stoichiometric coefficient and Ai stands for a chemical formula. The species on
the left are reactants; those on the right, products. The sign convention for νi is as follows:
​positive (+) for products​

and ​ negative (− ) for reactants​​

For example, when the ammonia synthesis reaction is written:
​N​2​+ 3 ​H​2​→ 2​NH​3​
then	​
​ν​​N​2​​ = − 1​ ​ν​​H​2​​ = − 3​ ​ν​​NH​3​​ = 2​​
This sign convention allows the definition of a standard heat of reaction to be expressed
mathematically by the simple equation:
	​ΔH° ≡ ​∑​ ​​ν​i​H​i°​​​	
i

(4.15)

where ​H​i°​​is the enthalpy of species i in its standard state and the summation is over all products and reactants. The standard-state enthalpy of a chemical compound is equal to its heat of
formation plus the standard-state enthalpies of its constituent elements. If the standard-state
enthalpies of all elements are arbitrarily set equal to zero as the basis of calculation, then
the standard-state enthalpy of each compound is simply its heat of formation. In this event,​
H​i°​​= Δ​H​​f°i​​​​and Eq. (4.15) becomes:
	​ΔH° = ​∑​ ​​ν​i​Δ​H​fi°​​	
i

(4.16)

where the summation is over all products and reactants. This formalizes the procedure
described in the preceding section for calculation of standard heats of other reactions from
standard heats of formation. Applied to the reaction,
​4HCl(g) + ​O​2​(g) → 2​H​2​O(g) + 2​Cl​2​(g)​

150

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects

Eq. (4.16) is written:
​ΔH° = 2Δ​H​​f°​​H​2​O​​ − 4Δ​H​​f°​HCl​​
With data from Table C.4 of App. C. for 298.15 K, this becomes:

° ​= ​(​2​)​(​−241,818​)​− ​(​4​)​(​−92,307​)​= −114,408 J​​
​Δ​H​298
in agreement with the result of Ex. 4.5. Note that for pure elemental gases that normally exist
as dimers (e.g., O2, N2, H2), it is the dimer form that is arbitrarily assigned a standard-state
enthalpy of zero.
For standard reactions, products and reactants are always at the standard-state pressure
of 1 bar. Standard-state enthalpies are therefore functions of temperature only, and by Eq. (2.20),
​d​H​i°​​= ​C​​P°​i​​ dT​
where subscript i identifies a particular product or reactant. Multiplying by νi and summing
over all products and reactants gives:
​∑​ ​​ν​i​d​H​i°​​= ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​C​​P°​i​​ dT​
i

i

Because νi is a constant, it may be placed inside the differential:
​​∑​ ​d(​ν​i​​H​i°​​) = ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​C​​P°​i​​ dT​
i

i

or ​ d​∑​ ​​ν​i​​H​i°​​= ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​C​​P°​i​​ dT​
i

i

The term ​∑​i​​ν​i​​H​i°​​is the standard heat of reaction, defined by Eq. (4.15) as ΔH°. The standard
heat-capacity change of reaction is defined similarly:
	​Δ​C​P°​≡ ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​C​​P°​i​​	​
From these definitions,

i

	​​dΔH° = Δ​C​P°​dT​​	

(4.17)
(4.18)

This is the fundamental equation relating heats of reaction to temperature.
Integration of Eq. (4.18) yields:
T

​ΔH° − Δ​H​0°​​= ​ ​ ​Δ​C​P°​dT​
∫​T​0​
where ​ΔH°​and ​Δ​H​0°​​are the standard heats of reaction at temperature T and at reference temperature T0 respectively. This equation is more conveniently expressed as:
T Δ​C​°​
P
	​ΔH° = Δ​H​0°​​+ R​ ​ ​​_____​dT​	
(4.19)
∫​T​0​ R

The reference temperature T0 must be a temperature for which the heat of reaction is
known or can be calculated as described in the two preceding sections, most often 298.15 K.
What Eq. (4.19) provides is the means for calculation of a heat of reaction at temperature T
from a known value at temperature T0.
If the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of each product and reactant is given
by Eq. (4.5), then the integral is given by the analog of Eq. (4.8):

(4.22)

The integral of Eq. (4.20) is of the same form as that of Eq. (4.8), and in analogous fashion may be set equal to a defined function:15

only difference is in the function name.

HEAT EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIAL REACTIONS

The preceding sections have dealt with the standard heat of reaction. Industrial reactions are
rarely carried out under standard-state conditions. Furthermore, in actual reactions the reactants may not be present in stoichiometric proportions, the reaction may not go to completion,
and the final temperature may differ from the initial temperature. Moreover, inert species may
be present, and several reactions may occur simultaneously. Nevertheless, calculations of the
heat effects of actual reactions are based on the principles already considered and are illustrated by the following examples, wherein the ideal-gas state is assumed for all gases.

Example 4.7
What is the maximum temperature that can be reached by the combustion of methane
with 20% excess air? Both the methane and the air enter the burner at 25°C.

153

4.7. Heat Effects of Industrial Reactions

Solution 4.7
The reaction is CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O(g) for which,

0

° ​= −393,509 + (2) (−241,818) − (−74,520) = −802,625 J​
​ ​H​298
Δ
Because the maximum attainable temperature (called the theoretical flame
temperature) is sought, assume that the combustion reaction goes to completion
adiabatically (Q = 0). If the kinetic- and potential-energy changes are negligible
and if Ws = 0, the overall energy balance for the process reduces to ΔH = 0.
For purposes of calculation of the final temperature, any convenient path
between the initial and final states may be used. The path chosen is indicated in
the diagram.

When one mole of methane burned is the basis for all calculations, the following quantities of oxygen and nitrogen are supplied by the entering air:
​Moles O​2​ required = 2.0
= 0.4​
   
​Moles excess O​2​ = (0.2)(2.0)
  
​
​
​Moles N​2​ entering = (2.4)(79/21) = 9.03
The mole numbers ni of the gases in the product stream leaving the burner are
1 mol CO2, 2 mol H2O(g), 0.4 mol O2, and 9.03 mol N2. Because the enthalpy
change must be independent of path,

where all enthalpies are on the basis of 1 mol CH4 burned. The enthalpy change of
the products as they are heated from 298.15 K to T is:
	​Δ​H​P°​= ​⟨​C​P°​⟩H
​ ​​ (T − 298.15)​	
where we define ​​⟨​C​P°​⟩​H​​​as the mean heat capacity for the total product stream:

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects
The simplest procedure here is to sum the mean-heat-capacity equations for the
products, each multiplied by its appropriate mole number. Because C = 0 for each
product gas (Table C.1), Eq. (4.9) yields:
​∑​i​​n​i​​B​i​
​∑​i​​n​i​​D​i​
​​⟨​C​P°​⟩H

Data from Table C.1 are combined as follows:
​A = ​∑​ ​​n​i​​Ai​​= (1)(5.457) + (2)(3.470) + (0.4)(3.639) + (9.03)(3.280) = 43.471​
i

Similarly, ​B = ​∑​ ​​n​i​​B​i​= 9.502 × ​10​​−3​and D
​ = ​∑​ ​​n​i​​D​i​= − 0.645 × ​10​​5​.​

i

For the product stream ​​⟨​C​P°​⟩H
​ ​​ / R​is therefore represented by:
​MCPH(298.15, T; 43.471, 9.502 × ​10​​−3​, 0.0, − 0.645 × ​10​​5​)​
Equations (A) and (B) are combined and solved for T:

° ​
Δ​H​298
​T = 298.15 − ___________
​ 
 ​​
​⟨​C​P°​⟩​H​​
Because the mean heat capacities depend on T, one first evaluates ⟨​
​​ C​P°​⟩H
​ ​​​ for an
assumed value of T > 298.15, then substitutes the result in the preceding equation.
This yields a new value of T for which ​​⟨​C​P°​⟩H
​ ​​​is reevaluated. The procedure continues to convergence on the final value,
​T = 2066 K  

or  

1793° C​

Again, solution can be easily automated with the Goal Seek or Solver function
in a spreadsheet or similar solve routines in other software packages.

Example 4.8
One method for the manufacture of “synthesis gas” (a mixture of CO and H2) is the
catalytic reforming of CH4 with steam at high temperature and atmospheric pressure:
​CH​4​(g) +  ​H​2​O(g) →

CO(g) + ​3H​2​(g)​

The only other reaction considered here is the water-gas-shift reaction:
​CO(g) + ​H​2​O(g) →

​CO​2​(g) + ​H​2​(g)​

Reactants are supplied in the ratio 2 mol steam to 1 mol CH4, and heat is added to the
reactor to bring the products to a temperature of 1300 K. The CH4 is completely converted, and the product stream contains 17.4 mol-% CO. Assuming the reactants to be
preheated to 600 K, calculate the heat requirement for the reactor.

155

4.7. Heat Effects of Industrial Reactions

Solution 4.8
The standard heats of reaction at 25°C for the two reactions are calculated from
the data of Table C.4:
​CH​4​(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → CO(g) + ​3H​2​(g)

° ​= 205,813 J​
Δ​H​298

° ​= −41,166 J​
​CO(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → ​CO​2​(g) + ​H​2​(g)​   Δ​H​298
These two reactions may be added to give a third reaction:
​CH​4​(g) + ​2H​2​O(g) →

​CO​2​(g) + ​4H​2​(g)

° ​= 164,647 J​
Δ​H​298

Any pair of the three reactions constitutes an independent set. The third reaction
is not independent; it is obtained by combination of the other two. The reactions
most convenient to work with here are the first and third:

° ​= 205,813 J​	
	​
​CH​4​(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → CO(g) + ​3H​2​(g)   Δ​H​298

(A)

° ​= 164,647 J​	
​CH​4​(g) + ​2H​2​O(g) → ​CO​2​(g) + ​4H​2​(g)      ​H​298

(B)

First one must determine the fraction of CH4 converted by each of these reactions.
As a basis for calculations, let 1 mol CH4 and 2 mol steam be fed to the reactor.
If x mol CH4 reacts by Eq. (A), then 1 − x mol reacts by Eq. (B). On this basis the
products of the reaction are:
CO:
H2:
CO2:
H2O:

x
3x + 4(1 − x) = 4 − x
1−x
2 − x − 2(1 − x) = x

Total: 5 mol products
The mole fraction of CO in the product stream is x/5 = 0.174; whence x = 0.870.
Thus, on the basis chosen, 0.870 mol CH4 reacts by Eq. (A) and 0.130 mol reacts
by Eq. (B). Furthermore, the amounts of the species in the product stream are:
Moles CO = x = 0.87
​Moles H​2​ = 4 − x = 3.13
  
  
​   
​ ​ ​
​Moles CO​2​ = 1 − x = 0.13
​Moles H​2​O = x = 0.87
We now devise a path, for purposes of calculation, to proceed from reactants at
600 K to products at 1300 K. Because data are available for the standard heats of
reaction at 25°C, the most convenient path is the one which includes the reactions
at 25°C (298.15 K). This is shown schematically in the accompanying diagram.
The dashed line represents the actual path for which the enthalpy change is ΔH.
Because this enthalpy change is independent of path,

​ΔH = Δ​H​R°​+ Δ​H​298

157

4.7. Heat Effects of Industrial Reactions
Therefore,
​ΔH = −34,390 + 200,460 + 161,940 = 328,010 J​
The process is one of steady flow for which Ws, Δz, and Δu2/2 are presumed
negligible. Thus,
​Q = ΔH = 328, 010 J​
This result is on the basis of 1 mol CH4 fed to the reactor.

Example 4.9
Solar-grade silicon can be manufactured by thermal decomposition of silane at moderate pressure in a fluidized-bed reactor, in which the overall reaction is:
​SiH​4​(g) → Si(s) + 2​H​2​(g)​
When pure silane is preheated to 300°C, and heat is added to the reactor to promote
a reasonable reaction rate, 80% of the silane is converted to silicon and the products
leave the reactor at 750°C. How much heat must be added to the reactor for each
kilogram of silicon produced?

Solution 4.9
For a continuous-flow process with no shaft work and negligible changes in kinetic
and potential energy, the energy balance is simply Q = ΔH, and the heat added is
the enthalpy change from reactant at 300°C to products at 750°C. A convenient
path for calculation of the enthalpy change is to (1) cool the reactant to 298.15 K,
(2) carry out the reaction at 298.15 K, and (3) heat the products to 750°C.
On the basis of 1 mol SiH4, the products consist of 0.2 mol SiH4, 0.8 mol Si,
and 1.6 mol H2. Thus, for the three steps we have:

Data needed for this example are not included in App. C, but are readily
obtained from the NIST Chemistry Webbook (http://webbook.nist.gov). The
reaction here is the reverse of the formation reaction for silane, and its standard
° ​= − 34,310 J​. Thus, the reaction is mildly

For these parameters, and with T in Kelvins, the equation for ΔH yields values
in joules. For the three steps making up the solution to this problem, the following
results are obtained:
1. Substitution of the parameters for 1 mol of SiH4 into the equation for ΔH leads upon
evaluation to: ΔH1 = −14,860​​J
2. Here, ​Δ​H​2​= (0.8)(− 34,310) = − 27,450 J​
3. Substitution of the parameters for the total product stream into the equation for ΔH
leads upon evaluation to: ΔH3 = 58,060 J
For the three steps the sum is:
​ΔH = − 14,860 − 27,450 + 58,060 = 15,750 J​
This enthalpy change equals the heat input per mole of SiH4 fed to the reactor. A kilogram of silicon, with a molar mass of 28.09, is 35.60 mol. Producing a kilogram of
silicon therefore requires a feed of 35.60/0.8 or 44.50 mol of SiH4. The heat requirement per kilogram of silicon produced is therefore (15,750)(44.5) = 700,900​​J.

4.7. Heat Effects of Industrial Reactions

Example 4.10
A boiler is fired with a high-grade fuel oil (consisting only of hydrocarbons) having a
standard heat of combustion of −43,515 J·g−1 at 25°C with CO2(g) and H2O(l) as products. The temperature of the fuel and air entering the combustion chamber is 25°C.
The air is assumed dry. The flue gases leave at 300°C, and their average analysis (on a
dry basis) is 11.2% CO2, 0.4% CO, 6.2% O2, and 82.2% N2. Calculate the fraction of the
heat of combustion of the oil that is transferred as heat to the boiler.

Solution 4.10
Take as a basis 100 mol dry flue gases, consisting of:
CO2
CO
O2
N2

11.2 mol
0.4 mol
6.2 mol
82.2 mol

Total

100.0 mol

This analysis, on a dry basis, does not take into account the H2O vapor present in
the flue gases. The amount of H2O formed by the combustion reaction is found
from an oxygen balance. The O2 supplied in the air represents 21 mol-% of the
air stream. The remaining 79% is N2, which goes through the combustion process
unchanged. Thus the 82.2 mol N2 appearing in 100 mol dry flue gases is supplied
with the air, and the O2 accompanying this N2 is:
Moles O2 entering in air = (82.2)(21 / 79) = 21.85
and
​Total moles O​2​ in the dry flue gases = 11.2 + 0.4 / 2 + 6.2 = 17.60​
The difference between these figures is the moles of O2 that react to form H2O.
Therefore on the basis of 100 mol dry flue gases,
​Moles H​2​O formed = (21.85 − 17.60) (2) = 8.50​
​Moles H​2​ in the fuel = moles of water formed = 8.50​
The amount of C in the fuel is given by a carbon balance:
​Moles C in flue gases = moles C in fuel = 11.2 + 0.4 = 11.60​
These amounts of C and H2 together give:
​Mass of fuel burned = ​(​8.50​)​(​2​)​+ ​(​11.6​)​(​12​)​= 156.2 g​​
If this amount of fuel is burned completely to CO2(g) and H2O(l) at 25°C, the
heat of combustion is:

° ​= (− 43,515) (156.2) = − 6,797,040 J​
​Δ​H​298

160

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects
However, the reaction actually occurring does not represent complete combustion,
and the H2O is formed as vapor rather than as liquid. The 156.2 g of fuel, consisting of 11.6 mol of C and 8.5 mol of H2, is represented by the empirical formula
C11.6H17. Omit the 6.2 mol O2 and 82.2 mol N2 which enter and leave the reactor
unchanged, and write the reaction:
​C​11.6​​H​17​(l) + 15.65​O​2​(g) → 11.2 ​CO​2​(g) + 0.4 CO(g) + 8.5 ​H​2​O(g)​
This result is obtained by addition of the following reactions, for each of which the
standard heat of reaction at 25°C is known:
​C​11.6​​H​17​(l) + 15.85 ​O​2​(g) → 11.6 ​CO​2​(g) + 8.5 ​H​2​O(l)
8.5
​H​2​O(l)​ ​  → 8.5 ​H​2​O(g)​
​​
  
    
 ​​​
0.4 ​CO​2​(g) → 0.4CO(g) + 0.2 ​O​2​(g)

° ​​
The sum of these reactions yields the actual reaction, and the sum of the ​Δ​H​298
values gives the standard heat of the reaction occurring at 25°C:
° ​= −6,797,040 + (44,012) (8.5) + (282,984) (0.4) = − 6,309,740 J​
​Δ​H​298
The actual process leading from reactants at 25°C to products at 300°C is represented by the dashed line in the accompanying diagram. For purposes of calculating ΔH for this process, we may use any convenient path. The one drawn with

and

° ​+ Δ​H​P°​= − 6, 309,740 + 940,660 = − 5,369,080 J​
​ΔH = Δ​H​298
Because the process is one of steady flow for which the shaft work and kineticand potential-energy terms in the energy balance [Eq. (2.32)] are zero or negligible, ΔH = Q. Thus, Q = −5369 kJ, and this amount of heat is transferred to the
boiler for every 100 mol dry flue gases formed. This represents

of the higher heat of combustion of the fuel.

In the foregoing examples of reactions that occur at approximately 1 bar, we have tacitly
assumed that the heat effects of reaction are the same whether gases are mixed or pure, an
acceptable procedure for low pressures. For reactions at elevated pressures, this may not be the
case, and it may be necessary to account for the effects of pressure and of mixing on the heat of
reaction. However, these effects are usually small. For reactions occurring in the liquid phase,
the effects of mixing are generally more important. They are treated in detail in Chapter 11.
For biological reactions, occurring in aqueous solution, the effects of mixing are particularly important. The enthalpies and other properties of biomolecules in solution usually
depend not only on temperature and pressure, but also on the pH, ionic strength, and concentrations of specific ions in solution. Table C.5 in App. C provides enthalpies of formation of
a variety of molecules in dilute aqueous solution at zero ionic strength. These can be used to
estimate heat effects of enzymatic or biological reactions involving such species. However,
corrections for effects of pH, ionic strength, and finite concentration may be significant.16
Heat capacities are often unknown for such species, but in dilute aqueous solution the overall specific heat is usually well approximated by the specific heat of water. Moreover, the
temperature range of interest for biological reactions is quite narrow. The following example
illustrates estimation of heat effects for a biological reaction.

16For analysis of these effects, see Robert A. Alberty, Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions, John Wiley &
Sons, Hoboken, NJ, 2003.

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects

Example 4.11
A dilute solution of glucose enters a continuous fermentation process, where yeast
cells convert it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The aqueous stream entering the reactor is at 25°C and contains 5 wt% glucose. Assuming this glucose is fully converted to
ethanol and carbon dioxide, and that the product stream leaves the reactor at 35°C,
estimate the amount of heat added or removed per kg of ethanol produced. Assume
that the carbon dioxide remains dissolved in the product stream.

Solution 4.11
For this constant pressure process with no shaft work, the heat effect is simply
equal to the enthalpy change from the feed stream to the product stream. The fermentation reaction is:
​C​6​​H​12​​O​6​(aq) → 2 ​C​2​​H​5​OH(aq) + 2 ​CO​2​(aq)​
The standard enthalpy of reaction at 298 K obtained using the heats of formation in dilute aqueous solution from Table C.5 is:

° ​= (2)(−288.3) + (2)(−413.8) − (−1262.2) = −142.0 ​kJ·mol​​−1​
​Δ​H​298
One kg of ethanol is 1/(0.046069 kg·mol−1) = 21.71 mol ethanol. Each mole
of glucose produces two moles of ethanol, so 10.85 mol of reaction must occur to
produce 1 kg of ethanol. The standard enthalpy of reaction per kg ethanol is then
(10.85)(−142.0) = −1541 kJ·kg−1. The mass of glucose required to produce 1 kg
ethanol is 10.85 mol × 0.18016 kg·mol−1 = 1.955 kg glucose. If the feed stream
is 5 wt% glucose, then the total mass of solution fed to the reactor per kg ethanol
produced is 1.955/0.05 = 39.11 kg. Assuming that the product stream has the
specific heat of water, about 4.184 kJ·kg−1·K−1, then the enthalpy change per kg
ethanol for heating the product stream from 25°C to 35°C is:
​4.184 kJ·​kg​​  −1​​·K​​−1​× 10 K × 39.11 kg = 1636 kJ.​
Adding this to the heat of reaction per kg ethanol gives the total enthalpy
change from feed to product, which is also the total heat effect:
​Q = ΔH = − 1541 + 1636 = 95 kJ​·(kg ethanol)​​−1​
This estimate leads to the conclusion that a small amount of heat must be added to
the reactor because the reaction exothermicity is not quite sufficient to heat the feed
stream to the product temperature. In an actual process, the glucose would not be fully
converted to ethanol. Some fraction of the glucose must be directed to other products
of cellular metabolism. This means that somewhat more than 1.955 kg glucose will be
needed per kg of ethanol produced. The heat release from other reactions may be somewhat higher or lower than that for the production of ethanol, which would change the
estimate. If some of the CO2 leaves the reactor as a gas, then the heat requirement will
be slightly higher because the enthalpy of CO2(g) is higher than that of aqueous CO2.

feed stream to the reactor consists of 60 mol-% HCl, 36 mol-% O2, and 4 mol-% N2,
and it enters the reactor at 550°C. If the conversion of HCl is 75% and if the process is
isothermal, how much heat must be transferred to or from the reactor per mole of the
entering gas mixture?
4.43. A gas consisting only of CO and N2 is made by passing a mixture of flue gas and
air through a bed of incandescent coke (assume pure carbon). The two reactions that
occur both go to completion:
​CO​2​+ C → 2CO​

and ​ 2C + ​O​2​→ 2CO​​

The flue gas composition is 12.8 mol-% CO, 3.7 mol-% CO2, 5.4 mol-% O2, and
78.1 mol-% N2. The flue gas/air mixture is so proportioned that the heats of the two
reactions cancel, and the temperature of the coke bed is therefore constant. If this
temperature is 875°C, if the feed stream is preheated to 875°C, and if the process is
adiabatic, what ratio of moles of flue gas to moles of air is required, and what is the
composition of the gas produced?

To suppress side reactions, the 1-butene feed stream is diluted with steam in the ratio

CHAPTER 4. Heat Effects

4.51. Quantitative thermal analysis has been suggested as a technique for monitoring the
composition of a binary gas stream. To illustrate the principle, do one of the following
problems.
(a) A methane/ethane gas mixture is heated from 25°C to 250°C at 1(atm) in a steadyflow process. If Q = 11,500 J·mol−1, what is the composition of the mixture?
(b) A benzene/cyclohexane gas mixture is heated from 100°C to 400°C at 1(atm)
in a steady-flow process. If Q = 54,000 J·mol−1, what is the composition of the
mixture?
(c) A toluene/ethylbenzene gas mixture is heated from 150°C to 250°C at 1(atm) in a

4.52. Saturated steam at 1(atm) and 100°C is continuously generated from liquid water at
1(atm) and 25°C by thermal contact with hot air in a counterflow heat exchanger. The

˙ ​​(steam)/​​n˙ ​(air) for two cases:

(b) Air enters the exchanger at 500°C.
For both cases, assume a minimum approach ΔT for heat exchange of 10°C.
4.53. Saturated water vapor, i.e., steam, is commonly used as a heat source in heat-­

for example, saturated steam at 4.5, 9, 17, and 33 bar. But the higher the pressure the
lower the useful energy content (why?), and the greater the unit cost. Why then is
higher-pressure steam used?

The Second Law of
Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics treats the principles of energy transformations, and the laws of thermodynamics
establish the bounds within which these transformations are observed to occur. The first law
states the principle of energy conservation, leading to energy balances in which work and heat are
included as simple additive terms. Yet work and heat are otherwise quite different. Work is directly
useful in ways that heat is not, e.g., for the elevation of a weight or for the acceleration of a mass.
Evidently, work is a form of energy intrinsically more valuable than an equal quantity of heat. This
difference is reflected in a second fundamental law which, together with the first law, makes up the
foundation upon which the edifice of thermodynamics is built. The purpose of this chapter is to:
∙ Introduce the concept of entropy, an essential thermodynamic property
∙ Present the second law of thermodynamics, which reflects the observation that limits
exist to what can be accomplished even by reversible processes
∙ Apply the second law to some familiar processes
∙ Relate changes in entropy to T and P for substances in the ideal-gas state
∙ Present entropy balances for open systems
∙ Demonstrate the calculation of ideal work and lost work for flow processes
∙ Relate entropy to the microscopic world of molecules

5.1

AXIOMATIC STATEMENTS OF THE SECOND LAW

The two axioms presented in Chapter 2 in relation to the first law have counterparts with
respect to the second law. They are:
Axiom 4: There exists a property called entropy1 S, which for systems
at internal equilibrium is an intrinsic property, functionally related to the
1Pronounced en’-tro-py to distinguish it clearly from en-thal’-py.

173

174

CHAPTER 5. The Second Law of Thermodynamics
measurable state variables that characterize the system. Differential
changes in this property are given by the equation:

	​​ ​dS​​  t​= ​dQ​ rev​​ / T ​​	

(5.1)

where St is the system (rather than the molar) entropy.
Axiom 5: (The Second Law of Thermodynamics) The entropy change
of any system and its surroundings, considered together, and resulting
from any real process, is positive, approaching zero when the process
approaches reversibility. Mathematically,
	​​ Δ​S​ total​​ ≥ 0 ​​	

(5.2)

The second law affirms that every process proceeds in such a direction that the total
entropy change associated with it is positive, the limiting value of zero being attained only by
a reversible process. No process is possible for which the total entropy decreases. The practical
utility of the second law is illustrated by application to two very common processes. The first
shows its consistency with our everyday experience that heat flows from hot to cold. The second
shows how it establishes limits to the conversion of heat to work by any device.

Application of the Second Law to Simple Heat Transfer
First, consider direct heat transfer between two heat reservoirs, bodies imagined capable of absorbing
or rejecting unlimited quantities of heat without temperature change.2 The equation for the
entropy change of a heat reservoir follows from Eq. (5.1). Because T is constant, integration gives:
Q
	​
ΔS = __
​   ​​	
T
A quantity of heat Q is transferred to or from a reservoir at temperature T. From the reservoir’s point of view the transfer is reversible, because its effect on the reservoir is the same
regardless of source or sink of the heat.
Let the temperatures of the reservoirs be TH and TC with TH > TC. Heat quantity Q,
transferred from one reservoir to the other, is the same for both reservoirs. However, QH and
QC have opposite signs: positive for the heat added to one reservoir and negative for the heat
extracted from the other. Therefore QH = −QC, and the entropy changes of the reservoirs at
TH and at TC are:
​QH
​  ​​ ​− Q​ C​​

Δ​S​ total​​ = Δ​S​  H ​​  + Δ​S​  C ​​  = _____

​T​ H​​​T​ C​​ )
2The firebox of a furnace is in effect a hot reservoir, and the surrounding atmosphere, a cold reservoir.

5.1. Axiomatic Statements of the Second Law

175

Because the heat-transfer process is irreversible, Eq. (5.2) requires a positive value for
ΔStotal, and therefore
	​​Q​ C​​​(​T​ H​​ − ​T​ C​​)​ > 0​	
With the temperature difference positive, QC must also be positive, which means that
heat flows into the reservoir at TC, i.e., from the higher to the lower temperature. This result
conforms to universal experience that heat flows from higher to lower temperature. A formal
statement conveys this result:
No process is possible which consists solely of the transfer of heat from
one temperature level to a higher one.
Note also that ΔStotal becomes smaller as the temperature difference decreases.
When TH is only infinitesimally higher than TC, the heat transfer is reversible, and ΔStotal
approaches zero.

Application of the Second Law to Heat Engines
Heat can be used far more usefully than by simple transfer from one temperature level to a
lower one. Indeed, useful work is produced by countless engines that employ the flow of heat
as their energy source. The most common examples are the internal-combustion engine and
the steam power plant. Collectively, these are heat engines. They all rely on a high-temperature
source of heat, and all discard heat to the environment.
The second law imposes restrictions on how much of their heat intake can be converted
into work, and our object now is to establish quantitatively this relationship. We imagine that
the engine receives heat from a higher-temperature heat reservoir at TH and discards heat to a
lower-temperature reservoir TC. The engine is taken as the system and the two heat reservoirs
comprise the surroundings. The work and heat quantities in relation to both the engine and the
heat reservoirs are shown in Fig. 5.1(a).
With respect to the engine, the first law as given by Eq. (2.3) becomes:
	​
ΔU = Q + W = ​QH
​ ​+ ​Q​C​+ W​	
Because the engine inevitably operates in cycles, its properties over a cycle do not
change. Therefore ΔU = 0, and W = −QH − QC.
The entropy change of the surroundings equals the sum of the entropy changes of the
reservoirs. Because the entropy change of the engine over a cycle is zero, the total entropy
change is that of the heat reservoirs. Therefore
​QH
​ ​ ​Q​C​
	​
Δ​S​total​= − ___
​ ​− ___
​ ​​	
​T​H​ ​T​C​
Note that QC with respect to the engine is a negative number, whereas QH is positive. Combining
this equation with the equation for W to eliminate QH yields:
​T​H​− ​T​C​
	​
W = ​T​H​Δ​S​total​+ ​Q​C​ ______
​
​ ​​	
( ​T​C​ )

This result gives the work output of a heat engine within two limits. If the engine is
totally ineffective, W = 0; the equation then reduces to the result obtained for simple heat
transfer between the two heat reservoirs, i.e.:
​T​H​− ​T​C​
	​
Δ​S​total​= − ​Q​C​ ______
​
​ ​​	
( ​T​H​​T​C​ )

The difference in sign here simply reflects the fact that QC is with respect to the engine,
whereas previously it was with respect to the lower-temperature reservoir.
If the process is reversible in all respects, then ΔStotal = 0, and the equation reduces to:
​T​ H​​
	​
W = ​Q​C​ ___
​   ​ − 1 ​​	
( ​T​ C​​
)

(5.3)

A heat engine operating as described in a completely reversible manner is very special
and is called a Carnot engine. The characteristics of such an ideal engine were first described
by N. L. S. Carnot3 in 1824.
Note again that QC is a negative number, as it represents heat transferred from the engine.
This makes W negative, in accord with the fact that work is not added to, but is produced by,
the engine. Clearly, for any finite value of W, QC is also finite. This means that a portion of
the heat transferred from the higher-temperature reservoir must inevitably be exhausted to the
lower-temperature reservoir. This observation can be given formal statement:
It is impossible to construct an engine that, operating in a cycle, produces
no effect (in system and surroundings) other than the extraction of heat
from a reservoir and the performance of an equivalent amount of work.

Sadi_Carnot.

5.1. Axiomatic Statements of the Second Law

177

The second law does not prohibit the continuous production of work from heat, but it does
place a limit on how much of the heat taken into a cyclic process can be converted into work.
Combining this equation with W = −QH − QC to eliminate first W and then QC leads to
Carnot’s equations:

​QH
​ ​ ​T​H​

(5.5)

Note that in application to a Carnot engine QH, representing heat transferred to the
engine, is a positive number, making the work produced (W) negative. In Eq. (5.4) the smallest possible value of QC is zero; the corresponding value of TC is absolute zero on the Kelvin
scale, which corresponds to −273.15°C.
The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of the work produced to
the heat supplied to the engine. With respect to the engine, the work W is negative. Thus,
−W
	​
η ≡ ___
​ ​​	
​QH

(5.6)

In view of Eq. (5.5) the thermal efficiency of a Carnot engine is:
​T​C​
	​​η​  Carnot​​ = 1 − ___
​ ​​	
​T​H​

(5.7)

Although a Carnot engine operates reversibly in all respects, and cannot be improved,
its efficiency approaches unity only when TH approaches infinity or TC approaches zero.
Neither condition exists on earth; all terrestrial heat engines therefore operate with thermal
efficiencies less than unity. The cold reservoirs available on earth are the atmosphere, lakes,
rivers, and oceans, for which TC ≃ 300 K. Hot reservoirs are objects such as furnaces where the
temperature is maintained by combustion of fossil fuels or by fission of radioactive elements,
and for which TH ≃ 600 K. With these values, η = 1 − 300/600 = 0.5, an approximate realistic
limit for the thermal efficiency of a Carnot engine. Actual heat engines are irreversible, and
η rarely exceeds 0.35.

Example 5.1
A central power plant, rated at 800,000 kW, generates steam at 585 K and discards
heat to a river at 295 K. If the thermal efficiency of the plant is 70% of the maximum
possible value, how much heat is discarded to the river at rated power?

Solution 5.1
The maximum possible thermal efficiency is given by Eq. (5.7). With TH as the
steam-generation temperature and TC as the river temperature:
295
	​​η​  Carnot​​ = 1 − ____
​ ​= 0.4957  and  η = (0.7)(0.4957) = 0.3470​

where η is the actual thermal efficiency. Combining Eq. (5.6) with the first law,
written W = −QH − QC, to eliminate QH, yields:

​Q​C​= ​ ___

This rate of heat transfer to a modest river would cause a temperature rise of several °C.

5.2

HEAT ENGINES AND HEAT PUMPS

The following steps make up the cycle of any Carnot engine:
∙ Step 1: A system at an initial temperature of a cold reservoir at TC undergoes a reversible
adiabatic process that causes its temperature to rise to that of a hot reservoir at TH.
∙ Step 2: The system maintains contact with the hot reservoir at TH and undergoes a
reversible isothermal process during which heat QH is absorbed from the hot reservoir.
∙ Step 3: The system undergoes a reversible adiabatic process in the opposite direction of
Step 1 that brings its temperature back to that of the cold reservoir at TC.
∙ Step 4: The system maintains contact with the reservoir at TC, and undergoes a reversible
isothermal process in the opposite direction of Step 2 that returns it to its initial state
with rejection of heat QC to the cold reservoir.
This set of processes can in principle be performed on any kind of system, but only a
few, yet to be described, are of practical interest.
A Carnot engine operates between two heat reservoirs in such a way that all heat
absorbed is transferred at the constant temperature of the hot reservoir and all heat rejected is
transferred at the constant temperature of the cold reservoir. Any reversible engine operating
between two heat reservoirs is a Carnot engine; an engine operating on a different cycle must
necessarily transfer heat across finite temperature differences and therefore cannot be reversible. Two important conclusions inevitably follow from the nature of the Carnot engine:
∙ Its efficiency depends only on the temperature levels and not upon the
working substance of the engine.
∙ For two given heat reservoirs no engine can have a thermal efficiency
higher than that of a Carnot engine.
We provide further treatment of practical heat engines in Chapter 8.
Because a Carnot engine is reversible, it may be operated in reverse; the Carnot cycle
is then traversed in the opposite direction, and it becomes a reversible heat pump operating
between the same temperature levels and with the same quantities QH, QC, and W as for the
engine but reversed in direction, as illustrated in Fig. 5.1(b). Here, work is required, and it is
used to “pump” heat from the lower-temperature heat reservoir to the higher-temperature heat
reservoir. Refrigerators are heat pumps with the “cold box” as the lower-temperature reservoir
and some portion of the environment as the higher-temperature reservoir. The usual measure

CARNOT ENGINE WITH IDEAL-GAS-STATE WORKING FLUID

The cycle traversed by a working fluid in its ideal-gas state in a Carnot engine is shown on
a PV diagram in Fig. 5.2. It consists of four reversible processes corresponding to Steps 1
through 4 of the general Carnot cycle described in the preceding section:
∙ a → b Adiabatic compression with temperature rising from TC to TH.
∙ b → c Isothermal expansion to arbitrary point c with absorption of heat QH.
∙ c → d Adiabatic expansion with temperature decreasing to TC.
∙ d → a Isothermal compression to the initial state with rejection of heat QC.
In this analysis the ideal-gas-state working fluid is regarded as the system. For the isothermal steps b → c and d → a, Eq. (3.20) yields:

Because ΔSt is a property change, it is independent of path and is given by ​S​B​− ​S​A​.​
If the fluid is changed from state A to state B by an irreversible process, the entropy

change is again ​Δ​S​t​ = ​S​B​ − ​S​A​​, but experiment shows that this result is not given by
​∫dQ / T​evaluated for the irreversible process itself, because the calculation of entropy changes by this
integral must, in general, be along reversible paths.
The entropy change of a heat reservoir, however, is always given by Q/T, where Q is the
quantity of heat transferred to or from the reservoir at temperature T, whether the transfer is
reversible or irreversible. As noted earlier, the effect of heat transfer on a heat reservoir is the
same regardless of the temperature of the source or sink of the heat.
If a process is reversible and adiabatic, dQrev = 0; then by Eq. (5.1), dSt = 0. Thus the
entropy of a system is constant during a reversible adiabatic process, and the process is said
to be isentropic.
The characteristics of entropy may be summarized as follows:
∙ Entropy relates to the second law in much the same way that internal energy relates to
the first law. Equation (5.1) is the ultimate source of all equations that connect entropy
to measurable quantities. It does not represent a definition of entropy; there is none in
the context of classical thermodynamics. What it provides is the means for calculating
changes in this property.
∙ The change in entropy of any system undergoing a finite reversible process is given by the
integral form of Eq. (5.1). When a system undergoes an irreversible process between two
equilibrium states, the entropy change of the system Δ
​ ​S​​  t​​is evaluated by application of
Eq. (5.1) to an arbitrarily chosen reversible process that accomplishes the same change
of state as the actual process. Integration is not carried out for the irreversible path.
Because entropy is a state function, the entropy changes of the irreversible and reversible
processes are identical.
∙ In the special case of a mechanically reversible process (Sec. 2.8), the entropy change
of the system is correctly evaluated from ​∫dQ / T​applied to the actual process, even
though the heat transfer between system and surroundings represents an external
irreversibility. The reason is that it is immaterial, as far as the system is concerned,

CHAPTER 5. The Second Law of Thermodynamics
whether the temperature difference causing the heat transfer is infinitesimal (making
the process externally reversible) or finite. The entropy change of a system resulting only from the transfer of heat can always be calculated by ∫​ dQ / T,​whether the
heat transfer is accomplished reversibly or irreversibly. However, when a process is
irreversible on account of finite differences in other driving forces, such as pressure,
the entropy change is not caused solely by the heat transfer, and for its calculation
one must devise a mechanically reversible means of accomplishing the same change
of state.

ENTROPY CHANGES FOR THE IDEAL-GAS STATE

For one mole or a unit mass of fluid undergoing a mechanically reversible process in a closed
system, the first law, Eq. (2.7), becomes:
	​
dU = d​Qrev
​ ​− PdV​	
Differentiation of the defining equation for enthalpy, H = U + PV, yields:
	​
dH = dU + PdV + V dP​	
Eliminating dU gives:
	​
dH = d​Qrev
​ ​− PdV + PdV + VdP​	
or
	​
d​Qrev
​ ​= dH − VdP​	
For the ideal-gas state, d​​H​ig​ = ​C​Pig​​dT and ​V​ig​ = RT / P​

Although derived for a mechanically reversible process, this equation
relates properties only, independent of the process causing the change

changes in the ideal-gas state.

A 40 kg steel casting (CP = 0.5 kJ⋅kg−1⋅K−1) at a temperature of 450°C is quenched
in 150 kg of oil (CP = 2.5 kJ⋅kg−1⋅K−1) at 25°C. If there are no heat losses, what is the
change in entropy of (a) the casting, (b) the oil, and (c) both considered together?

Solution 5.4
The final temperature t of the oil and the steel casting is found by an energy balance. Because the change in energy of the oil and steel together must be zero,
	​
(40)(0.5)(t− 450) + (150)(2.5)(t − 25) = 0​

ENTROPY BALANCE FOR OPEN SYSTEMS

Just as an energy balance is written for processes in which fluid enters, exits, or flows
through a control volume (Sec. 2.9), so too may an entropy balance be written. There is,
however, an important difference: Entropy is not conserved. The second law states that the
total entropy change associated with any process must be positive, with a limiting value of

186

CHAPTER 5. The Second Law of Thermodynamics

zero for a reversible process. This requirement is taken into account by writing the entropy
balance for both the system and its surroundings, considered together, and by including an
entropy-­generation term to account for the irreversibilities of the process. This term is the sum
of three others: one for the difference in entropy between exit and entrance streams, one for
entropy change within the control volume, and one for entropy change in the surroundings.
If the process is reversible, these three terms sum to zero, making ΔStotal = 0. If the process is
irreversible, they sum to a positive quantity, the entropy-generation term.
The statement of balance, expressed as rates, is therefore:

where ​​​S​​  G​​​ is the rate of entropy generation. This equation is the general rate form of the entropy
balance, applicable at any instant. Each term can vary with time. The first term is the time rate
of change of the total entropy of the fluid contained within the control volume. The second
term is the net rate of gain in entropy of the flowing streams, i.e., the difference between the
total entropy transported out by exit streams and the total entropy transported in by entrance
streams. The third term is the time rate of change of the entropy of the surroundings, resulting
from heat transfer between system

temperatures equal to those of the control surface or that work-producing Carnot engines are
interposed in the surroundings between the control-surface temperatures and the heat-reservoir

The rate of entropy generation is positive, as it must be for any real process.

Example 5.6
An inventor claims to have devised a process which takes in only saturated steam at
100°C and which by a complicated series of steps makes heat continuously available
at a temperature level of 200°C, with 2000 kJ of energy available at 200°C for every
kilogram of steam taken into the process. Show whether or not this process is possible.
To give this process the most favorable conditions, assume cooling water available
in unlimited quantity at a temperature of 0°C.

Solution 5.6
For any process to be even theoretically possible, it must meet the requirements of the
first and second laws of thermodynamics. The detailed mechanism need not be known
to determine whether this is true; only the overall result is required. If the claims of
the inventor satisfy the laws of thermodynamics, fulfilling the claims is theoretically
possible. The determination of a mechanism is then a matter of ingenuity. Otherwise,
the process is impossible, and no mechanism for carrying it out can be devised.
In the present instance, a continuous process takes in saturated steam at 100°C,
and makes heat Q continuously available at a temperature level of 200°C. Because
cooling water is available at 0°C, the maximum possible use is made of the steam if
it is condensed and cooled (without freezing) to this exit temperature and discharged

189

5.6. Entropy Balance for Open Systems
at atmospheric pressure. This is a limiting case (most favorable to the inventor), and
requires a heat-exchange surface of infinite area.
It is not possible in this process for heat to be liberated only at the 200°C temperature level, because as we have shown no process is possible that does nothing
except transfer heat from one temperature level to a higher one. We must therefore
suppose that some heat Qσ is transferred to the cooling water at 0°C. Moreover,
the process must satisfy the first law; thus by Eq. (2.32):
	​
ΔH = Q + ​Qσ​ ​+ ​Ws​​​	
where ΔH is the enthalpy change of the steam as it flows through the system.
Because no shaft work accompanies the process, Ws = 0. The surroundings consist of cooling water, which acts as a heat reservoir at the constant temperature of
Tσ = 273.15 K, and a heat reservoir at T = 473.15 K to which heat in the amount of
2000 kJ is transferred for each kilogram of steam entering the system. The diagram
of Fig. 5.5 indicates overall results of the process based on the inventor’s claim.

The values of H and S shown on Fig. 5.5 for liquid water at 0°C and for saturated steam at 100°C are taken from the steam tables (App. E). Note that the values for liquid water at 0°C are for saturated liquid (Psat = 0.61 kPa), but the effect
of an increase in pressure to atmospheric pressure is insignificant. On the basis of
1 kg of entering steam, the first law becomes:
	​
ΔH = ​H​2​− ​H​1​= 0.0 − 2676.0 = −2000 + ​Qσ​ ​  and  ​Qσ​ ​= −676.0 kJ​	
The negative value for Qσ indicates heat transfer is from the system to the
­cooling water.
We now examine this result in the light of the second law to determine whether
the entropy generation is greater than or less than zero for the process. Equation
(5.18) is here written:

	​

This negative result means that the process as described is impossible; the second
law in the form of Eq. (5.18) requires SG ≥ 0.
The negative result of the preceding example does not mean that all processes of this general
nature are impossible; only that the inventor claimed too much. Indeed, the maximum amount
of heat which can be transferred to the hot reservoir at 200°C is readily calculated. The energy
balance is:
	​
Q + ​Qσ​ ​= ΔH​	

(A)

The maximum heat transfer to the hot reservoir occurs when the process is completely reversible, in which case SG = 0, and Eq. (5.18) becomes

5.7 CALCULATION OF IDEAL WORK
In any steady-state flow process requiring work, an absolute minimum amount of work is
required to produce the desired change of state in the fluid flowing through the control volume. In a process producing work, an absolute maximum amount of work can be realized from
a given change of state of the fluid flowing through the control volume. In either case, the
limiting value results when the change of state associated with the process is accomplished
completely reversibly. For such a process, the entropy generation is zero, and Eq. (5.17), written for a uniform surroundings temperature Tσ, becomes:

A completely reversible process is hypothetical, devised here solely for determination of the
ideal work associated with a given change of state.
The sole connection between an actual process and an imagined hypothetical
reversible process employed for determining ideal work is that they both
apply to the same changes of state.

Our objective is to compare the actual work of a process W

balance to the ideal work as given by Eqs. (5.19) through (5.22) for a hypothetical reversible
process that produces the same property changes. No description of the hypothetical process is

CHAPTER 5. The Second Law of Thermodynamics

Example 5.7
What is the maximum work that can be obtained in a steady-state flow process from
1 mol of nitrogen in its ideal-gas state at 800 K and 50 bar? Take the temperature and
pressure of the surroundings as 300 K and 1.0133 bar.

Solution 5.7
The maximum possible work is obtained from any completely reversible process
that reduces the nitrogen to the temperature and pressure of the surroundings, i.e.,
to 300 K and 1.0133 bar. Required here is the calculation of Wideal by Eq. (5.22),
in which ΔS and ΔH are the molar entropy and enthalpy changes of the nitrogen
as its state changes from 800 K and 50 bar to 300 K and 1.0133 bar. For the
ideal-gas state, enthalpy is independent of pressure, and its change is given by:
​T​ 2​​

	​
Δ​H​ig​= ​ ​  ​​C​Pig​​dT ​​	
∫ ​T​ 1​​
The value of this integral is found from Eq. (4.8), and is represented by:
8.314 × ICPH(800, 300; 3.280, 0.593 ×𝟣𝟢−3, 0.0, 0.040 × 𝟣𝟢−5) = −15,060 J⋅​mol​​−1​
where the parameters for nitrogen come from Table C.1 of App. C.
Similarly, the entropy change is found from Eq. (5.10), here written:
​T​ 2​​
dT
​P​2​
	​
Δ​S​ig​= ​ ​  ​C​Pig​​___
​ ​ ​− R ln ___
​ ​​	
∫ ​T​ 1​​
T
​P​1​

The value of the integral, found from Eq. (5.11), is represented by:
	​8.314 × ICPS(800, 300; 3.280, 0.593 ×𝟣𝟢−3, 0.0, 0.040 × 𝟣𝟢−5) = −29.373 J⋅​mol​​−1​⋅​K​−1​​	
1.0133
Whence, ​
Δ​S​ig​= −29.373 − 8.314 ln ______
​
​= 3.042 J⋅​mol​​−1​⋅​K​−1​​	
50
With these values of ΔHig and ΔSig, Eq. (5.22) becomes:
	​
​W​ideal​= −15,060 − (300)(3.042) = −15,973 J⋅​mol​​−1​​	
One can easily devise a specific reversible process to bring about the given change of state
of the preceding example. Suppose the nitrogen is continuously changed to its final state at
1.0133 bar and T2 = Tσ = 300 K by the following two-step steady-flow process:
∙ Step 1: Reversible, adiabatic expansion (as in a turbine) from initial state P1, T1, H1 to
1.0133 bar. Let T′ denote the discharge temperature.
∙ Step 2: Cooling (or heating, if T′ is less than T2) to the final temperature T2 at a constant
pressure of 1.0133 bar.
For step 1, with Q = 0, the energy balance is Ws = ΔH = (H′ − H1), where H′ is the
enthalpy at the intermediate state of T′ and 1.0133 bar.

5.7. Calculation of Ideal Work

193

For maximum work production, step 2 must also be reversible, with heat exchanged
reversibly with the surroundings at Tσ. This requirement is satisfied when Carnot engines
take heat from the nitrogen, produce work WCarnot, and reject heat to the surroundings at Tσ.
Because the temperature of the nitrogen decreases from T′ to T2, Eq. (5.5) for the work of a
Carnot engine is written in differential form:
​Tσ​ ​
​Tσ​ ​
	​
d​W​Carnot​= ​ __
​ ​− 1 ​(​−dQ​)​= ​ 1 − __
​ ​ ​dQ​	
(T
)
(
T)
Here dQ refers to the nitrogen, which is taken as the system, rather than to the engine.
­Integration yields:
​T​ 2​​
dQ
​ ​ ​​	
	​
​W​Carnot​= Q − ​Tσ​ ​ ​  ​___
∫ T’ T

The first term on the right is the heat transferred with respect to the nitrogen, given by
Q = H2 − H′. The integral is the change in entropy of the nitrogen as it is cooled by the Carnot engines.
Because step 1 occurs at constant entropy, the integral also represents ΔS for both steps. Hence,
	​
​W​Carnot​= ​(​H​2​− ​H​′​)​− ​Tσ​ ​ΔS​​	
The sum of Ws and WCarnot gives the ideal work; thus,
	​
​W​ideal​=​(​H​′​− ​H​1​)​+ ​(​H​2​− ​H​′​)​− ​Tσ​ ​ΔS = ​(​H​2​− ​H​1​)​− ​Tσ​ ​ΔS​​	
or
	​
​W​ideal​= ΔH − ​Tσ​ ​ΔS​	
which is the same as Eq. (5.22).
This derivation makes clear the difference between Ws, the reversible adiabatic shaft
work of the turbine, and Wideal. The ideal work includes not only Ws, but also all work obtainable from Carnot engines for the reversible exchange of heat with the surroundings at Tσ. In
practice, work produced by a turbine can be as much as 80% of the reversible adiabatic work,
but usually no mechanism is present for extraction of WCarnot.5

Example 5.8
Rework Ex. 5.6, making use of the equation for ideal work.

Solution 5.8
The procedure here is to calculate the maximum possible work Wideal which can
be obtained from 1 kg of steam in a flow process as it undergoes a change in state
from saturated steam at 100°C to liquid water at 0°C. The problem then reduces
to the question of whether this amount of work is sufficient to operate a Carnot

supply of cooling water at 0°C. From Ex. 5.6, we have

	​
ΔH = −2676.0 kJ⋅​kg​​−1​  and  ΔS = −7.3554 kJ⋅​K​−1​⋅​kg​​−1​​	
With negligible kinetic- and potential-energy terms, Eq. (5.22) yields:
	​
​W​ideal​= ΔH − ​Tσ​ ​ΔS = −2676.0 − (273.15)(−7.3554) = −666.9 kJ⋅k​g​−1​​	
If this amount of work, numerically the maximum obtainable from the steam, is
used to drive the Carnot refrigerator operating between the temperatures of 0°C
and 200°C, the heat rejected is found from Eq. (5.5), solved for QH:
T

​
​ ​= 666.9​ __________
​   ​ ​= 1577.7 kJ​	
( ​Tσ​ ​− T )
( 200 − 0 )
As calculated in Ex. 5.6, this is the maximum possible heat release at 200°C; it is
less than the claimed value of 2000 kJ. As in Ex. 5.6, we conclude that the process
as described is not possible.

5.8

LOST WORK

Work that is wasted as the result of irreversibilities in a process is called lost work, Wlost, and
is defined as the difference between the actual work of a change of state and the ideal work for
the same change of state. Thus by definition,
	​
​W​lost​≡ ​Ws​​− ​W​ideal​​	

(5.25)

In terms of rates,

	​​​W​​  lost​​ ≡ ​​W​​  s​​ − ​​W​​  ideal​​​	

(5.26)

The actual work rate comes from the energy balance, Eq. (2.29), and the ideal work rate is
obtained using Eq. (5.19):

Multiplication by Tσ gives:		​​Tσ​ ​​​S​​  G​​ = ​Tσ​ ​Δ​(​S​m​​)​​  fs​​ − ​Q​​

∙

∙

	​​ ​​W​​  lost​​ = ​Tσ​ ​​​S​​  G​​ ​​	
∙

(5.29)
∙

As a consequence of the second law, ​​​S​​  G​​ ≥∙ 0;​it follows that ​​​W​​  lost​​ ≥ 0.​When a process is
completely reversible,
the equality holds, and W
​​​ ​​  lost​​ = 0.​For irreversible processes the inequal∙
ity holds, and W
​​​ ​​  lost​​,​i.e., the energy that becomes unavailable for work, is positive.
The engineering significance of this result is clear: The greater the irreversibility of a process, the greater the rate of entropy production and
the greater the amount of energy made unavailable for work. Thus every
irreversibility carries with it a price. Minimizing entropy production is
essential for conservation of the earth’s resources.

​W​lost​= ​Tσ​ ​S​G​​	

(5.34)

Again, because SG ≥ 0, it follows that Wlost ≥ 0.

Example 5.9
The two basic types of steady-flow heat exchanger are characterized by their flow patterns: cocurrent and countercurrent. Temperature profiles for the two types are indicated in Fig. 5.6. In cocurrent flow, heat is transferred from a hot stream, flowing from
left to right, to a cold stream flowing in the same direction, as indicated by arrows. In
countercurrent flow, the cold stream, again flowing from left to right, receives heat
from the hot stream flowing in the opposite direction.

Although the total rate of heat transfer is the same for both exchangers, the
temperature rise of the cold stream in countercurrent flow is more than
twice that for cocurrent flow. Thus, its entropy increase per unit mass is larger
than for the cocurrent case. However, its flow rate is less than half that of
the cold stream in cocurrent flow, so that the total entropy increase of the cold
stream is less for countercurrent flow. From a thermodynamic point
of view, the
∙
∙
countercurrent case is much more efficient. Because Δ(​​S​​  ig​​​​n​​)fs = ​​SG
​​ , both the rate
of entropy generation and the lost work for the countercurrent case are only about
half the value for the cocurrent case. Greater efficiency in the countercurrent case
would be anticipated based on Fig. 5.6, which shows that heat is transferred across
a smaller temperature difference (less irreversibly) in the countercurrent case.

THE THIRD LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

Measurements of heat capacities at very low temperatures provide data for the calculation from
Eq. (5.1) of entropy changes down to 0 K. When these calculations are made for different crystalline forms of the same chemical species, the entropy at 0 K appears to be the same for all forms.
When the form is noncrystalline, e.g., amorphous or glassy, calculations show that the entropy of
the disordered form is greater than that of the crystalline form. Such calculations, which are summarized elsewhere,6 lead to the postulate that the absolute entropy is zero for all perfect crystalline
substances at absolute zero temperature. While this essential idea was advanced by Nernst and
6K. S. Pitzer, Thermodynamics, 3d ed., chap. 6, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1995.

Rev. Confirming Pages

198

CHAPTER 5. The Second Law of Thermodynamics

Planck at the beginning of the twentieth century, more recent studies at very low temperatures have
increased confidence in this postulate, which is now accepted as the third law of thermodynamics.
If the entropy is zero at T = 0 K, then Eq. (5.1) lends itself to the calculation of absolute
entropies. With T = 0 as the lower limit of integration, the absolute entropy of a gas at temperature T based on calorimetric data is:
​T​ f​​
​Tυ​  ​​

Δ​H​f​

​T​f​ ∫ ​T​ f​​ T
​Tυ​ ​ ∫ ​Tυ​  ​​ T

(5.35)

This equation7 is based on the supposition that no solid-state transitions take place and thus no
heats of transition need appear. The only constant-temperature heat effects are those of melting at Tf and vaporization at Tυ. When a solid-phase transition occurs, a term ΔHt /Tt is added.
Note that although the third law implies that absolute values of entropy are obtainable,
for most thermodynamic analyses, only relative values are needed. As a result, reference states
other than the perfect crystal at 0 K are commonly used. For example, in the steam tables of
App. E, ­saturated liquid water at 273.16 K is taken as the reference state and assigned zero
entropy. However, the absolute or “third law” entropy of saturated liquid water at 273.16 K is
3.515 kJ⋅kg−1⋅K−1.

5.10

ENTROPY FROM THE MICROSCOPIC VIEWPOINT

Because molecules in the ideal-gas state do not interact, their internal energy resides with
individual molecules. This is not true of the entropy, which is inherently a collective property
of a large number of molecules or other entities. The microscopic interpretation of entropy is
suggested by the following example.
Suppose an insulated container, partitioned into two equal volumes, contains Avogadro’s number NA of molecules in one section and no molecules in the other. When the partition
is withdrawn, the molecules quickly distribute themselves uniformly throughout the total volume. The process is an adiabatic expansion that accomplishes no work. Therefore,
ig
​ T = 0​	
	​
ΔU = ​C​V​Δ

and the temperature does not change. However, the pressure of the gas decreases by half, and
the entropy change, as given by Eq. (5.10), is:
​P​2​
	​
Δ​S​ig​= −R ln ___
​ ​= R ln 2​	
​P​1​
Because this is the total entropy change, the process is clearly irreversible.
At the instant when the partition is removed, the molecules occupy only half the space
available to them. In this momentary initial state, the molecules are not randomly distributed
over the total volume to which they have access but are crowded into just half the total volume. In this sense they are more ordered than they are in the final state of uniform distribution
throughout the entire volume. Thus, the final state can be regarded as a more random, or more
disordered, state than the initial state. Generalizing from this example, and from many other

similar observations, one is led to the notion that increasing disorder (or decreasing structure)
at the molecular level corresponds to increasing entropy.
The means for expressing disorder in a quantitative way was developed by L. Boltzmann
and J. W. Gibbs through a quantity Ω, defined as the number of different ways that microscopic particles can be distributed among the “states” accessible to them. It is given by the
general formula:
N!
	​Ω = _____________
​  ​​	
​(​N​1​!​)​(​N​2​!​)​(​N​3​!​)​. . .

(5.36)

where N is the total number of particles, and N1, N2, N3, etc., represent the numbers of particles in “states” 1, 2, 3, etc. The term “state” denotes a condition of the microscopic particles,
and the quotation marks distinguish this idea of state from the usual thermodynamic meaning
as applied to a macroscopic system.
With respect to our example there are but two “states” for each molecule, representing
location of the given molecule in one half or the other of the container. The total number of
particles is NA molecules, and initially they are all in a single “state.” Thus
​N​A​!
	​
​Ω​1​= _______
​
​= 1​	
​(​N​A​!​)​(​0!​)​
This result confirms that initially the molecules can be distributed between the two accessible
“states” in just one way. They are all in a given “state,” all in just one half of the container. For
an assumed final condition of uniform distribution of the molecules between the two halves of
the container, N1 = N2 = NA/2, and

This expression gives a very large number for Ω2, indicating that the molecules can be distributed uniformly between the two “states” in many different ways. Many other values of Ω2
are possible, each one of which is associated with a particular nonuniform distribution of the
molecules between the two halves of the container. The ratio of a particular Ω2 to the sum of
all possible values is the probability of that particular distribution.
The connection established by Boltzmann between entropy S and Ω is given by the equation:

Eq. (5.10), the classical thermodynamic formula for the ideal-gas state.
Equations (5.36) and (5.37) provide a basis for relating macroscopic thermodynamic
properties to the microscopic configurations of molecules. Here we have applied them to a
very simple, and somewhat contrived, situation involving molecules in the ideal gas state, in
order to provide a simple illustration of this connection between molecular configurations and
macroscopic properties. The field of science and engineering devoted to studying and exploiting this connection is called statistical thermodynamics or statistical mechanics. The methods
of statistical thermodynamics are well developed, and are now routinely applied, in combination with computational simulation of the behavior of molecules, to make useful predictions of
thermodynamic properties of real substances without recourse to experiment.8

Thermodynamic Properties
of Fluids

Application of thermodynamics to practical problems requires numerical values of thermodynamic properties. A very simple example is calculation of the work required for a steady-state
gas compressor. If designed to operate adiabatically with the purpose of raising the pressure of
a gas from P1 to P2, this work can be determined by an energy balance [Eq. (2.32)], wherein
the small kinetic- and potential-energy changes of the gas are neglected:
​Ws​​= ΔH = ​H​2​− ​H​1​
The shaft work is simply ΔH, the difference between inlet and outlet values for the enthalpy of
the gas. The necessary enthalpy values must come from experimental data or by estimation. It
is our purpose in this chapter to:
∙ Develop from the first and second laws the fundamental property relations which
underlie the mathematical structure of applied thermodynamics for systems of constant
composition
∙ Derive equations that allow calculation of enthalpy and entropy values from PVT and
heat-capacity data
∙ Illustrate and discuss the types of diagrams and tables used to present property values
for convenient use
∙ Develop generalized correlations that provide estimates of property values in the absence
of complete experimental information

6.1

FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY RELATIONS

Equation (2.6), the first law for a closed system of n moles of a substance, may be written for
the special case of a reversible process:
​d(nU) = d​Qrev
​ ​+ d​Wrev
​ ​
210

211

6.1. Fundamental Property Relations
Equations (1.3) and (5.1) as applied to this process are:
​d​Wrev
​ ​= − P d​(​nV​)​

d​Qrev
​ ​= T d(nS)​​

These three equations combine to give:
	​
​d​(​nU​)​= T d​(​nS​)​− P d​(​nV​)​​	

(6.1)

where U, S, and V are molar values of the internal energy, entropy, and volume. All of the
primitive thermodynamic properties—P, V, T, U, and S—are included in this equation. It is
a fundamental property relation connecting these properties for closed PVT systems. All
other equations relating properties of such systems derive from it.
Additional thermodynamic properties, beyond those appearing in Eq. (6.1), are defined
as a matter of convenience, in relation to the primary properties. Thus, the enthalpy, defined
and applied in Chap. 2, is joined here by two others. The three, all with recognized names and
useful applications, are:
	​
Enthalpy H ≡ U + PV​	
	​
Helmholtz energy A ≡ U − TS​	
	​
Gibbs energy G ≡ U + PV − TS = H − TS​	

(6.2)
(6.3)
(6.4)

The Helmholtz energy and Gibbs energy,1 with their origins here, find application in phaseand chemical-equilibrium calculations and in statistical thermodynamics.
Multiplication of Eq. (6.2) by n, followed by differentiation, yields the general expression
	​
​d​(​nH​)​= d​(​nU​)​+ P d​(​nV​)​+ nV dP​​
Substitution for d(nU) by Eq. (6.1) reduces this result to
	​​​​d​(​nH​)​= T d​(​nS​)​+ nV dP​​​​	

(6.5)

The differentials of nA and nG are obtained similarly:
	​​​d​(​nA​)​= − nS dT − P d​(​nV​)​​​	

(6.6)

	​​​d​(​nG​)​= − nS dT + nV dP​​​	

(6.7)

Equations (6.1) and (6.5) through (6.7) are equivalent fundamental property relations. They
are derived for a reversible process. However, they contain only properties of the system.
which depend only on the state of the system, and not the path by which it reached that state.
These equations are therefore not restricted in application to reversible processes. However,
the restrictions placed on the nature of the system cannot be relaxed.
Application is to any process in a closed PVT system resulting in a differential change from one equilibrium state to another.
The system may consist of a single phase (a homogeneous system), or it may comprise
­several phases (a heterogeneous system); it may be chemically inert, or it may undergo
1These have traditionally been called Helmholtz free energy and the Gibbs free energy. The word free originally had
the connotation of energy available to perform useful work, under appropriate conditions. However, in current usage,
the word free adds nothing, and is best omitted. Since 1988, the IUPAC-recommended terminology omits the word free.

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids

chemical reaction. The choice of which equation to use in a particular application is dictated
by ­convenience. However, the Gibbs energy G is special, because of its unique functional relation
to T and P, the variables of primary interest by virtue of the ease of their measurement and control.
An immediate application of these equations is to one mole (or to a unit mass) of a
homogeneous fluid of constant composition. For this case, n = 1, and they simplify to:
​dU = T dS − P dV​	

(6.8) ​dH = T dS + V dP​	

(6.9)

​dA = −S dT − P dV​	

(6.10) ​dG = −S dT + V dP​	 (6.11)

Implicit in each of these equations is a functional relationship that expresses a molar (or unit
mass) property as a function of a natural or special pair of independent variables:
​U = U(S, V)

H = H(S, P) A = A(T, V) G = G(T, P)​

These variables are said to be canonical,2 and a thermodynamic property known as a
function of its canonical variables has a unique characteristic:
All other thermodynamic properties may be evaluated from it by simple
mathematical operations.
Equations (6.8) through (6.11) lead to another set of property relations because they
are exact differential expressions. In general, if F = F(x, y), then the total differential of F is
defined as:
∂F
∂F
​dF ≡ ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dx + ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dy​
( ∂x )
( ∂y )

or

​dF = M dx + N dy​

​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ = _____

The order of differentiation in mixed second derivatives is immaterial, and these equations
combine to give:
∂M
∂N
	​​​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​ = ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​​	
( ∂y ) ( ∂x )
y
x

(6.13)

Because F is a function of x and y, the right side of Eq. (6.12) is an exact differential expression,
and Eq. (6.13) correctly relates the partial derivatives. This equation serves in fact as the
­criterion of exactness. For example, y dx + x dy is a simple differential expression which is
exact because the derivatives of Eq. (6.13) are equal, i.e., 1 = 1. The function that produces
this expression is clearly F(x, y) = xy. On the other hand, y dx – x dy is an equally simple
­differential expression, but the derivatives of Eq. (6.13) are not equal, i.e., 1 ≠ −1, and it is not
exact. There is no function of x and y whose differential yields the original expression.
2Canonical here means that the variables conform to a general rule that is both simple and clear.

6.1. Fundamental Property Relations

The thermodynamic properties U, H, A, and G are known to be functions of the canonical
variables on the right sides of Eqs. (6.8) through (6.11). For each of these exact differential
expressions, we may write the relationship of Eq. (6.13), producing the Maxwell relations.3

Expression of U, H, A, and G as functions of their canonical variables does not preclude the
validity of other functional relationships for application to particular systems. Indeed, Axiom 3 of
Sec. 2.5, applied to homogeneous PVT systems of constant composition, asserts their dependence
on T and P. The restrictions exclude heterogeneous and reacting systems, except for G, for which
T and P are the canonical variables. A simple example is a system comprised of a pure liquid in
equilibrium with its vapor. Its molar internal energy depends on the relative amounts of liquid
and vapor present, and this is in no way reflected by T and P. However, the canonical variables
S and V also depend on the relative amounts of the phases, giving U = U(S, V) its greater
generality. On the other hand, T and P are the canonical variables for the Gibbs energy, and
G = G(T, P) is general. Thus G is fixed for given T and P, regardless of the relative amounts of
the phases, and provides the fundamental basis for the working equations of phase equilibria.
Equations (6.8) through (6.11) lead not only to the Maxwell relations but also to many
other equations relating thermodynamic properties. The remainder of this section develops
those most useful for evaluation of thermodynamic properties from experimental data.

Enthalpy and Entropy as Functions of T and P
In engineering practice, enthalpy and entropy are often the thermodynamic properties of interest, and T and P are the most common measurable properties of a substance or system. Thus,
their mathematical connections, expressing the variation of H and S with changes in T and P,
are needed. This information is contained in the derivatives (∂H/∂T)P, (∂S/∂T)P, (∂H/∂P)T, and
(∂S/∂P)T, with which we can write:

These are general equations relating enthalpy and entropy to temperature and pressure for
homogeneous fluids of constant composition. Eqs. (6.19) and (6.20) illustrate the utility of the
Maxwell relations, particularly Eqs. (6.16) and (6.17), which relate changes in entropy that are
not experimentally accessible to PVT data that are experimentally measurable.

The Ideal-Gas State
The coefficients of dT and dP in Eqs. (6.21) and (6.22) are evaluated from heat-capacity

These equations incorporating β, although general, are usually applied only to liquids. However, for liquids at conditions far from the critical point, both the volume and β are small. Thus
at most conditions pressure has little effect on the properties of liquids. The important idealization of an incompressible fluid (Sec. 3.2) is considered in Ex. 6.2.
Replacing (∂V/∂T)P in Eqs. (6.21) and (6.22) with βV yields:

For application to the change of state described, Eqs. (6.27) and (6.28) require
integration. Enthalpy and entropy are state functions, and the path of integration
is arbitrary; the path most suited to the given data is shown in Fig. 6.1. Because
the data indicate that CP is a weak function of T and that both V and β change
relatively slowly with P, integration with arithmetic means is satisfactory. The

Internal Energy and Entropy as Functions of T and V
In some circumstances, temperature and volume may be more convenient independent variables than temperature and pressure. The most useful property relations are then for internal energy and entropy. Required here are the derivatives (∂U/∂T )V, (∂U/∂V)T, (∂S/∂T )V, and

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids

With expressions for the four partial derivatives given by Eqs. (2.15), (6.31), (6.30), and
(6.16) we can write the required functional relations as:

Example 6.2
Develop the property relations appropriate to the incompressible fluid, a model fluid
for which both β and κ are zero (Sec. 3.2). This is an idealization employed in fluid
mechanics.

	​
dH = ​CP​ ​ dT + V dP​

​ ​

The enthalpy of an incompressible fluid is therefore a function of both temperature
and pressure, whereas the entropy is a function of temperature only, i­ndependent
of P. With κ = β = 0, Eq. (6.29) shows that the internal energy is also a function
of temperature only, and is therefore given by the equation, dU = CV dT. Equation
(6.13), the criterion of exactness, applied to Eq. (A), yields:

6.1. Fundamental Property Relations
However, the definition of β, given by Eq. (3.3), shows that the derivative on the
right equals βV, which is zero for an incompressible fluid. This means that CP is a
function of temperature only, independent of P.
The relation of CP to CV for an incompressible fluid is of interest. For a given
change of state, Eqs. (6.28) and (6.36) must give the same value for dS; they are
therefore equated. The resulting expression, after rearrangement, is:
βT
	​
​(​CP​ ​− ​CV​ ​)​dT = βTV dP + ___

Upon restriction to constant V, this reduces to:

Elimination of the derivative by Eq. (6.34) yields:

( κ)

(B)

Because β = 0, the right side of this equation is zero, provided that the indeterminate ratio β/κ is finite. This ratio is indeed finite for real fluids, and a contrary
presumption for the model fluid would be irrational. Thus the definition of the
incompressible fluid presumes this ratio is finite, and we conclude for such a fluid
that the heat capacities at constant V and at constant P are identical:

The Gibbs energy, G or G/RT, when given as a function of its canonical
variables T and P, serves as a generating function for the other thermodynamic properties through simple mathematics, and implicitly represents complete property information.
Just as Eq. (6.11) leads to expressions for all thermodynamic properties, so Eq. (6.10), the
fundamental property relation for the Helmholtz energy A = A(T, V), leads to equations for all
thermodynamic properties from knowledge of A as a function of T and V. This is particularly
useful in connecting thermodynamic properties to statistical mechanics because closed systems
at fixed volume and temperature are often most amenable to treatment by both theoretical
methods of statistical mechanics and computational methods of molecular simulation based
on statistical mechanics.

6.2

RESIDUAL PROPERTIES

Unfortunately, no experimental method for the measurement of numerical values of G or
G/RT is known, and the equations which relate other properties to the Gibbs energy are of
little direct practical use. However, the concept of the Gibbs energy as a generating function
for other thermodynamic properties carries over to a closely related property for which numerical values are readily obtained. By definition, the residual Gibbs energy is: GR ≡ G − Gig,
where G and Gig are the actual and the ideal-gas-state values of the Gibbs energy at the same
­temperature and pressure. Other residual properties are defined in an analogous way. The
residual volume, for example, is:
RT
	​
​V​R​≡ V − ​V​ig​= V − ___

P
Because V = ZRT/P, the residual volume and the compressibility factor are related:

(6.40)

The generic residual property4 is defined by:
	​
​M​R​≡ M − ​M​ig​​	

(6.41)

4Sometimes referred to as a departure function. Generic here denotes a class of properties with the same characteristics.

221

6.2. Residual Properties

where M and Mig are actual and ideal-gas-state properties at the same T and P. They represent
molar values for any extensive thermodynamic property, e.g., V, U, H, S, or G.
The underlying purpose of this definition is more easily understood when it is written as:
	​
M = ​M​ig​+ ​M​R​​	
From a practical perspective this equation divides property calculations into two parts: first,
simple calculations for properties in the ideal-gas state; second, calculations for the residual
properties, which have the nature of corrections to the ideal-gas-state values. Properties for the
ideal-gas state reflect real molecular configurations but presume the absence of intermolecular
interactions. Residual properties account for for the effect of such interactions. Our purpose
here is to develop equations for the calculation of residual properties from PVT data or from
their representation by equations of state.

Values of the compressibility factor Z = PV/RT and of (∂Z/∂T )P may be calculated from
experimental PVT data, with the two integrals in Eqs. (6.46), (6.48), and (6.49) evaluated by
numerical or graphical methods. Alternatively, the two integrals may be expressed analytically
with Z given as a function of T and P by a volume-explicit equation of state. This direct connection with experiment allows evaluation of the residual properties HR and SR for use in the
calculation of enthalpy and entropy values.

In Eqs. (6.50) through (6.53), HR and SR are given by Eqs. (6.46) and (6.48). Again, for computational purposes, the mean heat capacities are represented by:
ig

Applications of thermodynamics require only differences in enthalpy and entropy,
and these do not change when the scale of values is shifted by a constant amount. The
reference-state conditions T0 and P0 are therefore selected for convenience, and values
ig
ig
are assigned to ​H
​ ​0​ ​​and ​S​ ​0​ ​​arbitrarily. The only information needed for application of
Eqs. (6.52) and (6.53) are ideal-gas-state heat capacities and PVT data. Once V, H, and S
are known at given conditions of T and P, the other thermodynamic properties follow from
defining equations.
The great practical value of the ideal-gas state is now evident. It provides
the base for calculation of real-gas properties.
Residual properties have validity for both gases and liquids. However, the advantage
of Eqs. (6.50) and (6.51) in application to gases is that HR and SR, the terms which contain
all the complex calculations, are residuals that are usually small. They act as corrections to
the major terms, Hig and Sig. For liquids, this advantage is largely lost because HR and SR
must include the large enthalpy and entropy changes of vaporization. Property changes of
liquids are usually calculated by integrated forms of Eqs. (6.27) and (6.28), as illustrated
in Ex. 6.1.

Graphical integration requires simple plots of (∂Z/∂T )P/P and (Z −1)/P vs. P.
Values of (Z−1)/P are found from the compressibility-factor data at 360 K. The
quantity (∂Z/∂T )P/P requires evaluation of the partial derivative (∂Z/∂T)P, given
by the slope of a plot of Z vs. T at constant pressure. For this purpose, separate
plots are made of Z vs. T for each pressure at which compressibility-factor data
are given, and a slope is determined at 360 K for each curve (for example, by
construction of a tangent line at 360 K). Data for the required plots are shown
in Table 6.2.

Substitution of numerical values into Eqs. (6.50) and (6.51) yields:

Although calculations are here carried out for just one state, enthalpies and
entropies can be evaluated for any number of states, given adequate data. After
having completed a set of calculations, one is not irrevocably committed to the

particular values of ​H​0​ ​ and ​S​0​ ​ initially assigned. The scale of values for either
the enthalpy or the entropy can be shifted by addition of a constant to all values. In
this way one can give arbitrary values to H and S for some particular state so as to
make the scales convenient for some particular purpose.
The calculation of thermodynamic properties is an exacting task, seldom required of
an engineer. However, engineers do make practical use of thermodynamic properties, and an
understanding of methods by which they are calculated should suggest that some uncertainty
is associated with every property value. Inaccuracy derives partly from experimental error
in the data, which are also frequently incomplete and must be extended by interpolation and
extrapolation. Moreover, even with reliable PVT data, a loss of accuracy occurs in the differentiation process required in the calculation of derived properties. Thus data of high accuracy
are required to produce enthalpy and entropy values suitable for engineering calculations.

6.3 RESIDUAL PROPERTIES FROM THE VIRIAL EQUATIONS OF STATE
The numerical or graphical evaluation of integrals, as in Eqs. (6.46) and (6.48), is often tedious
and imprecise. An attractive alternative is analytical evaluation through equations of state. The
procedure depends on whether the equation of state is volume explicit, i.e., expresses V (or Z)
as a function of P at constant T, or pressure explicit, i.e., expresses P (or Z) as a function of
V (or ρ) at constant T.6 Equations (6.46) and (6.48) are directly applicable only for a volumeexplicit equation, such as the two-term virial equation in P [Eq. (3.36)]. For pressure-explicit
equations, such as the virial expansions in reciprocal volume [Eq. (3.38)], Eqs. (6.46), (6.48),
and (6.49) require reformulation.
The two-term virial equation of state, Eq. (3.36), is volume explicit, Z − 1 = BP/RT.
Differentiation yields (∂Z/∂T )P. We therefore have the required expressions for substitution
into Eqs. (6.46) and (6.48). Direct integration gives HR/RT and SR/R. An alternative procedure
is to evaluate GR/RT by Eq. (6.49):
​G​R​ BP

	​
​ ​= ___
​ ​​

(6.54)

From this result HR/RT is found from Eq. (6.44), and SR/R is given by Eq. (6.47). Either way,
we find:

Evaluation of residual enthalpies and residual entropies by Eqs. (6.55) and (6.56) is
straightforward for given values of T and P, provided one has sufficient information to evaluate B and dB/dT. The range of applicability of these equations is the same as for Eq. (3.36), as
discussed in Sec. 3.5.
6The ideal-gas equation of state is both pressure and volume explicit.

227

6.3. Residual Properties from the Virial Equations of State

Equations (6.46), (6.48), and (6.49) are incompatible with pressure-explicit equations of
state and must be transformed such that P is no longer the variable of integration. In carrying
out this transformation, the molar density ρ is a more convenient variable of integration
than V, because ρ goes to zero, rather than to infinity, as P goes to zero. Thus, the equation
PV = ZRT is written in alternative form as
	​
P = ZρRT​	

(6.57)

Differentiation at constant T gives:
	​
dP = RT​​(​Zdρ + ρdZ​)​ ​(​const T )​​

where the integral is evaluated at constant T. Note also that ρ → 0 when P → 0.

GENERALIZED PROPERTY CORRELATIONS FOR GASES

Of the two kinds of data needed for evaluation of thermodynamic properties, heat capacities
and PVT data, the latter are most frequently missing. Fortunately, the generalized methods
developed in Sec. 3.7 for the compressibility factor are also applicable to residual properties.
Equations (6.46) and (6.48) are put into generalized form by substitution of the relations:

The terms on the right sides of these equations depend only on the upper limit Pr of the
integrals and on the reduced temperature at which they are evaluated. Thus, values of HR/RTc
and SR/R may be determined once and for all at any reduced temperature and pressure from
generalized compressibility-factor data.
The correlation for Z is based on Eq. (3.53):

The first integrals on the right sides of these two equations may be evaluated n­ umerically
or graphically for various values of Tr and Pr from the data for Z0 given in Tables D.1 and D.3
of App. D, and the integrals which follow ω in each equation may be similarly evaluated from
the data for Z1 given in Tables D.2 and D.4.
If the first terms on the right sides of the preceding equations (including the minus
signs) are represented by (HR)0/RTc and (SR)0/R and if the terms which follow ω, together with
the preceding minus signs, are represented by (HR)1/RTc and (SR)1/R, then:

Calculated values of the quantities (HR)0/RTc, (HR)1/RTc, (SR)0/R, and (SR)1/R as determined by Lee and Kesler are given as functions of Tr and Pr in Tables D.5 through D.12.
These values, together with Eqs. (6.66) and (6.67), allow estimation of residual enthalpies and
entropies on the basis of the three-parameter corresponding-states principle as developed by
Lee and Kesler (Sec. 3.7).
Tables D.5 and D.7 for (HR)0/RTc and Tables D.9 and D.11 for (SR)0/R, used alone, provide two-parameter corresponding-states correlations that quickly yield rough estimates of the
residual properties. The nature of these correlations is indicated by Fig. 6.2, which shows a
plot of (HR)0/RTc vs. Pr for six isotherms.

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids

As with the generalized compressibility-factor correlation, the complexity of the functions
(HR)0/RTc, (HR)1/RTc, (SR)0/R, and (SR)1/R precludes their general representation by simple equations. However, the generalized second-virial-coefficient correlation forms the basis for analytical correlations of the residual properties at low pressures. Recall Eqs. (3.58) and (3.59):

Figure 3.10, drawn specifically for the compressibility-factor correlation, is also used as
a guide to the reliability of the correlations of residual properties based on generalized s­ econd
virial coefficients. However, all residual-property correlations are less accurate than the
compressibility-factor correlations on which they are based and are, of course, least reliable
for strongly polar and associating molecules.
The generalized correlations for HR and SR, together with ideal-gas heat capacities,
allow calculation of enthalpy and entropy values of gases at any temperature and pressure by Eqs. (6.50) and (6.51). For a change from state 1 to state 2, write Eq. (6.50) for
both states:
​T​2​

Just as we have given names to functions used in evaluation of the integrals in Eqs. (6.72) and
(6.73) and the mean heat capacities in Eqs. (6.74) and (6.75), we also name functions useful
for evaluation of HR and SR. Equations (6.68), (3.61), (6.70), (3.62), and (6.71) together provide a function for the evaluation of HR/RTc, named HRB(Tr, Pr, OMEGA):7
​H​R​
____
	​
​ ​= HRB ​(​T​r​, ​P​r​, OMEGA​)​​	
R​Tc​ ​
A numerical value of HR is therefore represented by:
	​
R​Tc​ ​× HRB ​(​T​r​, ​P​r​, OMEGA​)​​	
Similarly, Eqs. (6.69) through (6.71) provide a function for the evaluation of SR/R, named
SRB(Tr, Pr, OMEGA):
​S​R​
___
	​
​ ​= SRB ​(​T​r​, ​P​r​, OMEGA​)​
R
A numerical value of SR is therefore represented by:
	​
R × SRB ​(​T​r​, ​P​r​, OMEGA​)​
The terms on the right sides of Eqs. (6.72) through (6.75) are readily associated with steps in
a computational path leading from an initial to a final state of a system. Thus, in Fig. 6.3, the
actual path from state 1 to state 2 (dashed line) is replaced by a three-step computational path:
∙ Step 1 → 1ig: A hypothetical process that transforms a real gas into an ideal gas at T1
and P1. The enthalpy and entropy changes for this process are:

Equations (6.72) and (6.73) result from addition of the enthalpy and entropy changes for the
three steps.

Example 6.4
Supercritical CO2 is increasingly used as an environmentally friendly solvent for cleaning applications, ranging from dry cleaning clothing to degreasing machine parts to
photoresist stripping. A key advantage of CO2 is the ease with which it is separated
from “dirt” and detergents. When its temperature and pressure are reduced below the
critical temperature and vapor pressure respectively, it vaporizes, leaving dissolved
substances behind. For a change in state of CO2 from 70°C and 150 bar to 20°C and
15 bar, estimate the changes in its molar enthalpy and entropy.

Solution 6.4
We follow the three-step computational path of Fig. 6.3. Step 1 transforms the
real fluid at 70°C and 150 bar into its ideal-gas state at the same conditions.
Step 2 changes conditions in the ideal-gas state from the initial to the final
­conditions of T and P. Step 3 transforms the fluid from its ideal-gas state to the
real-gas final state at 20°C and 15 bar.

233

6.4. Generalized Property Correlations for Gases
The residual-property values required for calculating the changes of Steps 1
and 3 depend on the reduced conditions of the initial and final states. With critical
properties from Table B.1 of App. B:
	​
​T​r​​1​​= 1.128
​P​r​​1​​= 2.032

​T​r​​2​​= 0.964

​P​r​​2​​= 0.203​	

A check of Fig. 3.10 indicates that the Lee/Kesler tables are required for the
initial state, whereas the second-virial-coefficient correlation should be suitable
for the final state.
Thus, for Step 1, interpolation in Lee/Kesler tables D.7, D.8, D.11, and D.12
provides the values:
​(​H​R​)​0​
​(​H​R​)​1​
​(​S​R​)​0​

Then:

For Step 2, the enthalpy and entropy changes are calculated by the usual ­­
heat-capacity integrals, with polynomial coefficients from Table C.1. The
ideal-gas-state entropy change caused by the pressure change must also be included.
Δ​H​2​= 8.314 × ICPH(343.15, 293.15; 5.547, 1.045 × ​10​​−3​, 0.0, −1.157 × ​10​​5​)

​
= − 6.067 + 19.144 = 13.08 J ​⋅mol​​−1​​⋅K​​−1​
Finally, for Step 3,
Δ​H​3​= ​H​R​(​293.15 K, 15 bar​)​
​= 8.314 × 304.2 × HRB​​(​0.964, 0.203, 0.224​)​= − 660 J​⋅mol​​−1​

​= 8.314 × SRB​​(​0.964, 0.203, 0.224​)​= −1.59 J​⋅mol​​−1​⋅K​​−1​
Sums over the three steps yield overall changes, ΔH = 4734 J⋅mol−1 and
ΔS = 28.6 J⋅mol−1⋅K−1. The largest contribution here comes from the residual
properties of the initial state, because the reduced pressure is high, and the supercritical fluid is far from its ideal-gas state. Despite the substantial reduction in
temperature, the enthalpy actually increases in the overall process.
For comparison, the properties given in the NIST fluid-properties database,
accessed through the NIST Chemistry Webbook, are:
​H​1​= 16,776 J​⋅mol​​−1​   ​S​1​= 67.66 J​⋅mol​​−1​⋅K​​−1​
	​
     
​
​
​
​H​2​= 21,437 J​⋅mol​​−1​   ​S​1​= 95.86 J​⋅mol​​−1​⋅K​​−1​

234

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids
From these values, considered accurate, overall changes are ΔH = 4661 J⋅mol−1
and ΔS = 28.2 J⋅mol 1⋅K−1. Even though the changes in residual properties make
up a substantial part of the total, the prediction from generalized correlations
agrees with the NIST data to within 2 percent.

Extension to Gas Mixtures
Although no fundamental basis exists for extension of generalized correlations to mixtures,
reasonable and useful approximate results for mixtures can often be obtained with pseudocritical parameters resulting from simple linear mixing rules according to the definitions:
​ω ≡ ​∑​ ​​y​i​​ω​i​​  (6.78) ​​Tp​  c​​ ≡ ​∑​ ​y​  i​​ ​T​c​  ​ i​​​​​ (6.79)
i

i

​​Pp​  c​​ ≡ ​∑​ ​y​  i​​ ​P​c​  ​ i​​​​​ (6.80)
i

The values so obtained are the mixture ω and pseudocritical temperature and pressure, Tpc and
Ppc, which replace Tc and Pc to define pseudoreduced parameters:
T
P
​Tpr
​ ​= ___
​ ​​  (6.81) ​Ppr
​ ​= ___
​ ​​  (6.82)
​Tpc
​ ​

​ ​
These replace Tr and Pr for reading entries from the tables of App. D, and lead to values of Z
by Eq. (3.57), HR/RTpc by Eq. (6.66), and SR/R by Eq. (6.67).

Example 6.5
Estimate V, HR, and SR for an equimolar mixture of carbon dioxide(1) and propane(2) at
450 K and 140 bar by the Lee/Kesler correlations.

Solution 6.5
The pseudocritical parameters are found by Eqs. (6.78) through (6.80) with critical constants from Table B.1 of App. B:
ω = ​y​1​​ω​1​+ ​y​2​​ω​2​= ​(​0.5​)​(​0.224​)​+ ​(​0.5​)​(​0.152​)​= 0.188

TWO-PHASE SYSTEMS

The curves shown on the PT diagram of Fig. 3.1 represent phase boundaries for a pure substance. A phase transition at constant temperature and pressure occurs whenever one of these
curves is crossed, and as a result the molar or specific values of the extensive thermodynamic
properties change abruptly. Thus the molar or specific volume of a saturated liquid is very
different from the molar or specific volume of saturated vapor at the same T and P. This is true
as well for internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The exception is the molar or specific Gibbs
energy, which for a pure species does not change during a phase transition such as melting,
vaporization, or sublimation.
Consider a pure liquid in equilibrium with its vapor and existing in a piston/cylinder
arrangement that undergoes a differential evaporation at temperature T and corresponding
vapor pressure Psat. Equation (6.7) applied to the process reduces to d(nG) = 0. Because the
number of moles n is constant, dG = 0, and this requires the molar (or specific) Gibbs energy
of the vapor to be identical with that of the liquid. More generally, for two phases α and β of a
pure species coexisting at equilibrium,
	​
​G​α​= ​G​β​​	

(6.83)

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids

The Clapeyron equation, introduced as Eq. (4.12), follows from this equality. If the temperature of a two-phase system is changed, then the pressure must also change in accord with
the relation between vapor pressure and temperature if the two phases continue to coexist in
equilibrium. Because Eq. (6.83) applies throughout this change,
	​
d​G​α​= d​G​β​​	
Substituting expressions for dGα and dGβ as given by Eq. (6.11) yields:
	​
​V​α​d​P​sat​− ​S​α​dT = ​V​β​d​P​sat​− ​S​β​dT​	
which upon rearrangement becomes:
d​P​sat​ _______

Δ​S​αβ​
_____
	​
​
​= ​ β
​= ​ αβ ​​	
α

​V​ ​− ​V​ ​ Δ​V​ ​
The entropy change ΔSαβ and the volume change ΔVαβ are changes that occur when a unit
amount of a pure chemical species is transferred from phase α to phase β at the equilibrium T
and P. Integration of Eq. (6.9) for this change yields the latent heat of phase transition:
	​
Δ​H​αβ​= TΔ​S​αβ​​	

(6.84)

Thus, ΔSαβ = ΔHαβ/T, and substitution in the preceding equation gives:

Equations (6.86) through (6.88) are equivalent, exact forms of the Clapeyron equation for
pure-species vaporization.

237

6.5. Two-Phase Systems

Example 6.6
The Clapeyron equation for vaporization at low pressure is often simplified through
reasonable approximations, namely, that the vapor phase is an ideal gas and that the
molar volume of the liquid is negligible compared with the molar volume of the vapor.
How do these assumptions alter the Clapeyron equation?

Then by Eq. (6.87),

​
​​	
d​​(​1 / T )​
Known as the Clausius/Clapeyron equation, it relates the latent heat of vaporization
directly to the vapor-pressure curve. Specifically, it indicates a direct proportionality
of ΔHlv to the slope of a plot of ln Psat vs. 1/T. Such plots of experimental data produce
lines for many substances that are very nearly straight. The ­Clausius/Clapeyron
equation implies, in such cases, that ΔHlv is constant, virtually independent of T.
This is not in accord with experiment; indeed, ΔHlv decreases monotonically with
increasing temperature from the triple point to the critical point, where it becomes
zero. The assumptions upon which the Clausius/Clapeyron equation are based have
approximate validity only at low pressures.

Temperature Dependence of the Vapor Pressure of Liquids
The Clapeyron equation [Eq. (6.85)] is an exact thermodynamic relation, providing a vital
connection between the properties of different phases. When applied to the calculation of latent
heats of vaporization, its use presupposes knowledge of the vapor pressure-vs.-temperature
relation. Because thermodynamics imposes no model of material behavior, either in general or
for particular species, such relations are empirical. As noted in Ex. 6.6, a plot of ln Psat vs. 1/T
generally yields a line that is nearly straight:
B
	​
ln ​P​sat​= A − __
​ ​​	
T

(6.89)

where A and B are constants for a given species. This equation gives a rough approximation of
the vapor-pressure relation for the entire temperature range from the triple point to the critical
point. Moreover, it provides an excellent basis for interpolation between reasonably spaced
values of T.
The Antoine equation, which is more satisfactory for general use, is:
B
	​
ln ​P​sat​= A − _____
​
​​	
T+C

(6.90)

238

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids

A principal advantage of this equation is that values of the constants A, B, and C are
readily available for a large number of species.8 Each set of constants is valid for a specified
temperature range, and should not be used much outside that range. The Antoine equation is
sometimes written in terms of the base 10 logarithm, and the numerical values of the constants
A, B, and C depend on the units selected for T and P. Thus, one must exercise care when using
coefficients from different sources to ensure that the form of the equation and units are clear and
consistent. Values of Antoine constants for selected substances are given in Table B.2 of App. B.
The accurate representation of vapor-pressure data over a wide temperature range
requires an equation of greater complexity. The Wagner equation is one of the best available; it
expresses the reduced vapor pressure as a function of reduced temperature:
Aτ + B ​τ​1.5​+ C ​τ​3​+ D ​τ​6​
	​
ln ​P​rsat
​  ​ =   
​__________________​​

where

(6.91)

	​
τ ≡ 1 − ​Tr​​​	
and A, B, C, and D are constants. Values of the constants either for this equation or for the
Antoine equation are given by Prausnitz, Poling, and O’Connell9 for many species.

Corresponding-States Correlations for Vapor Pressure
A number of corresponding-states correlations are available for the vapor pressure of­
non-polar, non-associating liquids. One of the simplest is that of Lee and Kesler.10 It is a
Pitzer-type correlation, of the form:
	​
ln ​P​rsat
​  ​(​Tr​​)​= ln ​P​r0​​(​Tr​​)​+ ω ln ​P​r1​​(​Tr​​)​​	

(6.92)

where
6.09648
	​
ln ​P​r0​​(​Tr​​)​= 5.92714 − _______
​
​− 1.28862 ln ​Tr​​+ 0.169347 ​T​r6​​​	
​Tr​​

(6.93)

15.6875

​
​− 13.4721 ln ​Tr​​+ 0.43577 ​T​r6​​​	
​Tr​​

(6.94)

Lee and Kesler recommend that the value of ω used with Eq. (6.92) be found from the correlation by requiring that it reproduce the normal boiling point. In other words, ω for a particular
substance is determined from Eq. (6.92) solved for ω:
0

where ​T​r​​n​​ is the reduced normal boiling point temperature and ​P​​rsat
​n​​ ​is the reduced vapor pressure corresponding to 1 standard atmosphere (1.01325 bar).

Substitution of temperatures yields the values of Psat under the heading “Antoine”

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids

Solution 6.8
The volume of 1-butene vapor at 200°C and 70 bar is calculated directly from

For H and S, we use a computational path like that of Fig. 6.3, leading from an
initial state of saturated liquid 1-butene at 0°C, where H and S are zero, to the final
state of interest. In this case, an initial vaporization step is required, leading to the
four-step path shown by Fig. 6.4. The steps are:
(a) Vaporization at T1 and P1 = Psat.
(b) Transition to the ideal-gas state at (T1, P1).
(c) Change to (T2, P2) in the ideal-gas state.
(d) Transition to the actual final state at (T2, P2).

6.5. Two-Phase Systems

Step (a): Vaporization of saturated liquid 1-butene at 0°C. The vapor pressure
must be estimated, as it is not given. One method is based on the equation:
B
	​
ln ​P​sat​= A − __
​ ​​	
T
		 The vapor-pressure curve contains both the normal boiling point, for which
Psat = 1.0133 bar at 266.9 K, and the critical point, for which Psat = 40.43 bar
at 420.0 K. For these two points,

​ln 1.0133 = A − _____

​

​
​​	
420.0

Solution gives,

	​
​A = 10.1260​ B = 2699.11​​	
		

For 0°C (273.15 K), Psat = 1.2771 bar, a result used in steps (b) and (c). Here,
the latent heat of vaporization is required. Equation (4.13) provides an estimate at the normal boiling point, where ​T​r​​n​​ = 266.9 / 420.0 = 0.636​:

Δ​H​lv​​ 1.092​​(​ln ​Pc​ ​− 1.013​)​ ___________________

The latent heat at Tr = 273.15/420.0 = 0.650, is given by Eq. (4.14):

Moreover, by Eq. (6.84),

	​Δ​S​lv​= Δ​H​lv​/ T = 21,810 / 273.15 = 79.84 J ​⋅mol​​−1​​⋅K​​−1​​	
∙

Step (b): Transformation of saturated-vapor 1-butene to its ideal-gas state at
the initial conditions (T1, P1). Because the pressure is relatively low, the values of ​H
​ ​1R​​​and ​S​ ​1R​​​are estimated by Eqs. (6.68) and (6.69) for the reduced
conditions, Tr = 0.650 and Pr = 1.2771/40.43 = 0.0316. The computational procedure is represented by:
HRB​​(​0.650, 0.0316, 0.191​)​= − 0.0985
   
​
​
SRB​​(​0.650, 0.0316, 0.191​)​= − 0.1063

​S​1R​​= ​(​− 0.1063​)​(​8.314​)​= − 0.88 J ​⋅mol​​−1​​⋅K​​−1​
		

As indicated in Fig. 6.4, the property changes for this step are −
​ ​H​1R​​and −
​ ​S​1R​​​,
because the change is from the real to the ideal-gas state.

242

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids
∙

Step (c): Change in ideal-gas state from (273.15 K, 1.2771 bar) to (473.15 K,
70 bar). Here, ΔHig and ΔSig are given by Eqs. (6.76) and (6.77), for which
(Secs. 4.1 and 5.5):
8.314 × ICPH(273.15, 473.15; 1.967, 31.630 × 10−3, − 9.837 × 10−6, 0.0)

8.314 × ICPS(273.15, 473.15; 1.967, 31.630 × 10−3, − 9.837 × 10−6, 0.0)
= 55.474 J⋅mol−1⋅K−1

		

Thus, Eqs. (6.76) and (6.77) yield:

Step (d): Transformation of 1-butene from the ideal-gas state to the real-gas
state at T2 and P2. The final reduced conditions are:

	​
​Tr​​= 1.127​ ​Pr​​= 1.731​​	
		

At the higher pressure of this step, ​H​2R​​ and ​S​2R​​ are found by Eqs. (6.66) and
(6.67), together with the Lee/Kesler correlation. With interpolated values
from Tables D.7, D.8, D.11, and D.12, these equations give:

changes for the process leading from the initial reference state (where H and S
are set equal to zero) to the final state:

Two-Phase Liquid / Vapor Systems
When a system consists of saturated-liquid and saturated-vapor phases coexisting in equilibrium, the total value of any extensive property of the two-phase system is the sum of the total
properties of the phases. Written for the volume, this relation is:
	​
nV = ​n​l​​V​l​+ ​n​v​​V​v​
where V is the molar volume for a system containing a total number of moles n = nl + nv.
Division by n gives:
	​
V = ​x​l​​V​l​+ ​x​v​​V​v​​	
where xl and xv represent the mass fractions of the total system that are liquid and vapor. With
xl = 1 − xv,
	​
V = ​(​1 − ​x​v​)​V​l​+ ​x​v​​V​v​
In this equation the properties V, Vl, and Vv may be either molar or unit-mass values. The mass
or molar fraction of the system that is vapor xv is often called the quality, particularly when the
fluid in question is water. Analogous equations can be written for the other extensive thermodynamic properties. All of these relations are represented by the generic equation
	​
M = ​(​1 − ​x​v​)​M​l​+ ​x​v​​M​v​​	

(6.96a)

where M represents V, U, H, S, etc. An alternative form is sometimes useful:
	​
M = ​M​l​+ ​x​v​Δ​M​lv​​

(6.96b)

THERMODYNAMIC DIAGRAMS

A thermodynamic diagram is a graph showing a set of properties for a particular substance,
e.g., T, P, V, H, and S. The most common diagrams are: TS, PH (usually ln P vs. H), and HS
(called a Mollier diagram). The designations refer to the variables chosen for the coordinates.
Other diagrams are possible, but are seldom used.
Figures 6.5 through 6.7 show the general features of these diagrams. Though based on
data for water, their general character is similar for all substances. The two-phase states, represented by lines on the PT diagram of Fig. 3.1, lie over areas in these diagrams, and the triple
point of Fig. 3.1 becomes a line. Lines of constant quality in a liquid/vapor region provide
two-phase property values directly. The critical point is identified by the letter C, and the solid
curve passing through it represents states of saturated liquid (to the left of C) and of saturated
vapor (to the right of C). The Mollier diagram (Fig. 6.7) does not usually include volume
data. In the vapor or gas region, lines for constant temperature and constant superheat appear.
Superheat is a term denoting the difference between the actual temperature and the saturation
temperature at the same pressure. Thermodynamic diagrams included in this book are the PH
diagrams for methane and tetrafluoroethane, and the Mollier diagram for steam in App. F.
Some process paths are easily traced on particular thermodynamic diagrams. For ­example,
the boiler of a steam power plant has liquid water as feed at a temperature below its boiling point,
and superheated steam as product. Thus, water is heated at constant P to its saturation temperature
(line 1–2 in Figs. 6.5 and 6.6), vaporized at constant T and P (line 2–3), and superheated at constant
P (line 3–4). On a PH diagram (Fig. 6.5) the whole process is represented by a horizontal line

corresponding to the boiler pressure. The same process is shown on the TS diagram of Fig. 6.6.
The compressibility of a liquid is small for temperatures well below Tc, and liquid-phase properties
change very slowly with pressure. The constant-P lines on this diagram for the liquid region
therefore lie very close together, and line 1–2 nearly coincides with the saturated-liquid curve. The
isentropic path of the fluid in a reversible adiabatic turbine or compressor is represented on both
the TS and HS (Mollier) diagrams by a vertical line from the initial to the final pressure.

TABLES OF THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES

In many instances thermodynamic properties are tabulated. This has the advantage that data
can be presented more precisely than in diagrams, but the need for interpolation is introduced.
Thermodynamic tables for saturated steam from its normal freezing point to the critical point
and for superheated steam over a substantial pressure range appear in App. E. Values are given
at intervals close enough that linear interpolation is satisfactory.11 The first table shows the
equilibrium properties of saturated liquid and saturated vapor at even increments of temperature. The enthalpy and entropy are arbitrarily assigned values of zero for the saturated-liquid
state at the triple point. The second table is for the gas region and gives properties of superheated steam at temperatures higher than the saturation temperature for a given pressure. Volume (V), internal energy (U), enthalpy (H), and entropy (S) are tabulated as functions of
pressure at various temperatures. The steam tables are the most thorough compilation of properties for any single material. However, tables are available for a number of other substances.12
Electronic versions of such tables generally eliminate the need for manual interpolation.

Superheated steam originally at P1 and T1 expands through a nozzle to an exhaust pressure P2. Assuming the process is reversible and adiabatic, determine the ­downstream
state of the steam and ΔH for P1 = 1000 kPa, t1 = 250°C, and P2 = 200 kPa.

Solution 6.9
Because the process is both reversible and adiabatic, there is no change in the
entropy of the steam. For the initial temperature of 250°C at 1000 kPa, no entries
appear in the tables for superheated steam. Interpolation between values for 240°C
and 260°C yields, at 1000 kPa,
	​
​H​1​= 2942.9 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​    ​S​1​= 6.9252 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​​

CHAPTER 6. Thermodynamic Properties of Fluids
For the final state at 200 kPa,

	​
​S​2​= ​S​1​= 6.9252 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​​	
Because the entropy of saturated vapor at 200 Pa is greater than S2, the final state
must lie in the two-phase liquid/vapor region. Thus t2 is the saturation temperature at 200 kPa, given in the superheat tables as t2 = 120.23°C. Equation (6.96a)
applied to the entropy becomes:
	​
​S​2​= ​(​1 − ​x​2v​)​S​2l ​+ ​x​2v​​S​2v​​	
Numerically,
	​
6.9252 = 1.5301​​(​1 − ​x​2v​)​+ 7.1268 ​x​2v​​	
where the values 1.5301 and 7.1268 are entropies of saturated liquid and saturated
vapor at 200 kPa. Solving,
	​
​x​2v​ = 0.9640​	
The mixture is 96.40% vapor and 3.60% liquid. Its enthalpy is obtained by further
application of Eq. (6.96a):
	​
​H​2​= ​(​0.0360​)​(​504.7​)​+ ​(​0.9640​)​(​2706.3​)​= 2627.0 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​​	
Finally,
	​
ΔH = ​H​2​− ​H​1​= 2627.0 − 2942.9 = − 315.9 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​​	
For a nozzle, under the stated assumptions the steady-flow energy balance,
Eq. (2.31), becomes
1
	​
ΔH + __
​ ​Δ​u​2​= 0​	
2
Thus the decrease in enthalpy is exactly compensated by an increase in kinetic
energy of the fluid. In other words, the velocity of a fluid increases as it flows
through a nozzle, which is its usual purpose. Nozzles are treated further in Sec. 7.1.

Example 6.10
A 1.5 m3 tank contains 500 kg of liquid water in equilibrium with pure water vapor,
which fills the remainder of the tank. The temperature and pressure are 100°C and
101.33 kPa. From a water line at a constant temperature of 70°C and a constant pressure somewhat above 101.33 kPa, 750 kg of liquid is bled into the tank. If the temperature and pressure in the tank are not to change as a result of the process, how much
energy as heat must be transferred to the tank?

Solution 6.10
Choose the tank as the control volume. There is no work, and kinetic- and potentialenergy changes are assumed negligible. Equation (2.28) therefore is written

(A)

where Δmtank is the 750 kg of water bled into the tank, and subscripts 1 and 2 refer
to conditions in the tank at the beginning and end of the process. At the end of the
process the tank still contains saturated liquid and saturated vapor in equilibrium
at 100°C and 101.33 kPa. Hence, m1H1 and m2H2 each consist of two terms, one
for the liquid phase and one for the vapor phase.
The numerical solution makes use of the following enthalpies taken from the
steam tables:

At the end of the process, the masses of liquid and vapor are determined by a mass
balance and by the fact that the tank volume is still 1.5 m3:

Substitution of appropriate values into Eq. (A) gives:
	​
Q = 524,458 − 211,616 − ​(​750​)​(​293.0​)​= 93,092 kJ​	
Before conducting the rigorous analysis demonstrated here, one might make
a reasonable estimate of the heat requirement by assuming that it is equal to the
enthalpy change for heating 750 kg of water from 70°C to 100°C. This approach
would give 94,575 kJ, which is slightly higher than the rigorous result, because it
neglects the heat effect of condensing water vapor to accommodate the added liquid.

SYNOPSIS

After thorough study of this chapter, including multiple readings and working through example and end-of-chapter problems, one should be able to:
∙ Write and apply the fundamental property relations for internal energy, enthalpy, Gibbs
energy, and Helmholtz energy in both a general form applicable to any closed PVT
system [Eqs. (6.1), (6.5), (6.6), and (6.7)], and in a form applicable to one mole of a
homogeneous substance [Eqs. (6.8)–(6.11)]
∙ Write the Maxwell relations [Eqs. (6.14)–(6.17)], and apply them to replace unmeasurable
partial derivatives involving entropy with partial derivatives that can be determined
from PVT data
∙ Recognize that knowledge of any thermodynamic energy measure as a function of its
canonical variables [U(S, V), H(S, P), A(T, V) or G(T, P)] implicitly provides complete
property information
∙ Obtain any thermodynamic property from G/RT as a function of T and P
∙ Write thermodynamic functions in terms of alternative, noncanonical variables, including H(T, P), S(T, P), U(T, V), and S(T, V), and apply specialized forms of these for liquids, using the isothermal compressibility and volume expansivity
∙ Define and apply residual properties and relationships among them (e.g., the fundamental residual property relations)
∙ Estimate residual properties by:
The volume-explicit two-term virial equation of state, Eqs. (6.54)–(6.56)
The three-term pressure-explicit virial equation of state, Eqs. (6.61)–(6.63)
The full Lee/Kesler correlations, Eqs. (6.66) and (6.67) and App. D
The two-term virial equation with coefficients from the Abbott equations, Eq. (6.68)–(6.71)

∙ Explain the origins of the Clapeyron equation and apply it to estimate the change in
phase transition pressure with temperature from latent heat data and vice versa
∙ Recognize equality of Gibbs energy, temperature, and pressure as a criterion for phase
equilibrium of a pure substance
∙ Read common thermodynamic diagrams and trace the paths of processes on them
∙ Apply the Antoine equation and similar equations to determine vapor pressure at a given
temperature and enthalpy of vaporization, via the Clapeyron equation
∙ Construct multi-step computational paths that allow one to compute property changes
for arbitrary changes of state of a pure substance, making use of data or correlations for
residual properties, heat capacities, and latent heats

6.9 ADDENDUM. RESIDUAL PROPERTIES
IN THE ZERO-PRESSURE LIMIT
The constant J, omitted from Eqs. (6.46), (6.48), and (6.49), is the value of ​G​R​/ RT​in the limit
as P → 0. The following treatment of residual properties in this limit provides background.
Because a gas becomes ideal as P → 0 (in the sense that Z → 1), one might suppose that in this
limit all residual properties are zero. This is not in general true, as is easily demonstrated for
the residual volume.
Written for VR in the limit of zero pressure, Eq. (6.41) becomes

​lim ​​V​R​= ​lim ​V − ​lim ​​V​ig​​

Both terms on the right side of this equation are infinite, and their difference is indeterminate.

The center expression arises directly from Eq. (6.40), and the rightmost expression is obtained
by application of L’Hôpital’s rule. Thus, VR/RT in the limit as P → 0 at a given T is proportional to the slope of the Z-versus-P isotherm at P = 0. Figure 3.7 shows clearly that these
values are finite, and not, in general, zero.
For the internal energy, ​U​R​ ≡ U − ​U​ig​​. Because Uig is a function of T only, a plot of
ig
U vs. P for a given T is a horizontal line extending to P = 0. For a real gas with intermolecular forces, an isothermal expansion to P → 0 results in a finite increase in U because the
molecules move apart against the forces of intermolecular attraction. Expansion to P = 0
(V = ∞) reduces these forces to zero, exactly as in an ideal gas, and therefore at all temperatures,

For finite values of ​G​ig​/ RT​ at P > 0, we must have ​lim​​(​G​ig​/ RT ) = − ∞​. We cannot reasonably

Thus ​G​R​/ RT​(and of course GR) is, like VR, indeterminate in the limit as P → 0. In this case,
however, no experimental means exists for finding the limiting value. However, we have no
reason to presume it is zero, and therefore we regard it like ​lim​​​V​R​as finite, and not in general
P→0
zero.
Equation (6.44) provides an opportunity for further analysis. We write it for the limiting

where J is a constant of integration, independent of T, justifying the derivation of Eq. (6.46).

6.52. The total steam demand of a plant over the period of an hour is 6000 kg, but
instantaneous demand fluctuates from 4000 to 10,000 kg⋅h−1. Steady boiler operation at
6000 kg⋅h−1 is accommodated by inclusion of an accumulator, essentially a tank
containing mostly saturated liquid water that “floats on the line” between the boiler
and the plant. The boiler produces saturated steam at 1000 kPa, and the plant operates
with steam at 700 kPa. A control valve regulates the steam pressure upstream from
the accumulator and a second control valve regulates the pressure downstream
from the accumulator. When steam demand is less than boiler output, steam flows into
and is largely condensed by liquid residing in the accumulator, in the process increasing
the pressure to values greater than 700 kPa. When steam demand is greater than boiler
output, water in the accumulator vaporizes and steam flows out, thus reducing the
pressure to values less than 1000 kPa. What accumulator volume is required for this
service if no more that 95% of its volume should be occupied by liquid?

opened, the nitrogen flowing into the tank at first evaporates in the process of cooling
the tank. If the tank has a mass of 30 kg and the metal has a specific heat capacity of

Applications of
Thermodynamics to Flow
Processes
The thermodynamics of flow is based on the mass, energy, and entropy balances developed
in Chaps. 2 and 5. The application of these balances to specific processes is the subject of
this chapter. The discipline underlying the study of flow is fluid mechanics,1 which encompasses not only the balances of thermodynamics but also a momentum balance that arises
from the laws of classical mechanics (Newton’s laws). This makes fluid mechanics a broader
field of study. The distinction between thermodynamics problems and fluid-mechanics problems depends on whether this momentum balance is required for solution. Those problems
whose solutions depend only on mass conservation and on the laws of thermodynamics are
commonly set apart from the study of fluid mechanics and are treated in courses on thermodynamics. Fluid mechanics then deals with the broad spectrum of problems which require application of the momentum balance. This division, though arbitrary, is traditional and convenient.
For example, if the states and thermodynamic properties of a gas entering and leaving
a pipeline are known, then application of the first law establishes the quantity of the energy
exchanged with the surroundings. The mechanism of the process, the details of flow, and
the state path actually followed by the gas between entrance and exit are not pertinent to this
calculation. On the other hand, if one has only incomplete knowledge of initial or final state of
the gas, then more detailed information about the process is needed. Perhaps the exit pressure of
the gas is not specified. In this case, one must apply the momentum balance of fluid mechanics,
and this requires an empirical or theoretical expression for the shear stress at the pipe wall.
Flow is caused by pressure gradients within a fluid. Moreover, temperature, velocity,
and even concentration gradients may exist within a flowing fluid. This contrasts with the
uniform conditions that prevail at equilibrium in closed systems. The distribution of conditions in flow systems requires that properties be attributed to point masses of fluid. Thus
we assume that intensive properties, such as density, specific enthalpy, specific entropy, etc.,

at a point are determined solely by the temperature, pressure, and composition at the point,
uninfluenced by gradients that may exist at the point. Moreover, we assume that the fluid
exhibits the same set of intensive properties at the point as it would if it existed at equilibrium at the same temperature, pressure, and composition. The implication is that an equation
of state applies locally and instantaneously at any point in a fluid system, and that one may
invoke a concept of local state, independent of the concept of equilibrium. Experience shows
that this leads to results in accord with observation for a broad range of practical processes.
Thermodynamic analysis of flow processes is most often applied to processes involving
gases or supercritical fluids. In these compressible flow processes the fluid properties change
as a result of changes in pressure, and thermodynamic analysis provides relationships between
these changes. Thus, the intent of this brief chapter is to:
∙ Develop the thermodynamic equations applicable to one-dimensional steady-state flow
of compressible fluids in conduits.
∙ Apply these equations to flow (both subsonic and supersonic) in pipes and nozzles
∙ Treat throttling processes, i.e., flow through restrictions
∙ Calculate the work produced by turbines and expanders
∙ Examine compression processes as produced by compressors, pumps, blowers, fans, and
vacuum pumps
The equations of balance for open systems presented in Chaps. 2 and 5 are summarized
here in Table 7.1 for easy reference. In addition, Eqs. (7.1) and (7.2), restricted forms of the
mass balance, are included. These equations are the basis for thermodynamic analysis of
processes in this and the next two chapters. When combined with thermodynamic property
statements, they allow calculation of system states and process energy requirements.

DUCT FLOW OF COMPRESSIBLE FLUIDS

Such problems as sizing of pipes and shaping of nozzles require application of the momentum
balance of fluid mechanics, and therefore are not part of thermodynamics. However, thermodynamics does provide equations that interrelate the changes in pressure, velocity, cross-­
sectional area, enthalpy, entropy, and specific volume of a flowing stream. We consider here
the adiabatic, steady-state, one-dimensional flow of a compressible fluid in the absence of
shaft work and of changes in potential energy. The pertinent thermodynamic equations are
first derived, and are then applied to flow in pipes and nozzles.

Thus the pressure decreases and the velocity increases in the direction of flow. However,
the velocity cannot increase indefinitely. If the velocity were to exceed the sonic value, then
the above inequalities would reverse. Such a transition is not possible in a pipe of constant
cross-sectional area. For subsonic flow, the maximum fluid velocity obtainable in a pipe of
constant cross section is the speed of sound, and this value is reached at the exit of the pipe.
At this point dS/dx reaches its limiting value of zero. Given a discharge pressure low enough
for the flow to become sonic, lengthening the pipe does not alter this result; the sonic velocity
is still obtained at the outlet of the lengthened pipe.
The equations for pipe flow indicate that when flow is supersonic the pressure increases
and the velocity decreases in the direction of flow. However, such a flow regime is unstable,
and when a supersonic stream enters a pipe of constant cross section, a compression shock
occurs, the result of which is an abrupt and finite increase in pressure and decrease in velocity
to a subsonic value.

7.1. Duct Flow of Compressible Fluids

Example 7.1
For the steady-state, adiabatic, irreversible flow of an incompressible liquid in a
horizontal pipe of constant cross-sectional area, show that:
(a) The velocity is constant.
(b) The temperature increases in the direction of flow.
(c) The pressure decreases in the direction of flow.

Solution 7.1
(a) The control volume here is simply a finite length of horizontal pipe, with entrance
and exit sections identified as 1 and 2. By the continuity equation, Eq. (2.26),
​u​2​​A​2​ _____
​u​1​​A​1​
_____
	​
​
​= ​
​​	
​V​2​
​V​1​
However, A2 = A1 (constant cross-sectional area) and V2 = V1 (incompressible
fluid). Hence, u2 = u1.
(b) The entropy balance of Eq. (5.18) here becomes simply SG = S2 − S1. For an
incompressible liquid with heat capacity C (see Ex. 6.2),
T2
dT
	​
​S​G​= ​S​2​− ​S​1​= ​ ​  ​  ​C ___
​ ​​	
∫ T1
T

But SG is positive (flow is irreversible) and hence, by the last equation, T2 > T1,
and temperature increases in the direction of flow.
(c) As shown in (a), u2 = u1, and therefore the energy balance, Eq. (2.31), reduces
for the stated conditions to H2 − H1 = 0. Combining this with the integrated
form of Eq. (A) of Ex. 6.2 applied to an incompressible liquid yields:
T2

​H​2​− ​H​1​= ​ ​  ​  ​ C dT + V(​P​2​− ​P​1​) = 0​
∫ T1
and
T2

​V(​P​2​− ​P​1​) = −​ ​  ​  ​C dT​
∫ T1
As shown in (b), T2 > T1; thus by the last equation, P2 < P1, and pressure decreases
in the direction of flow.
Repeating this example for the case of reversible adiabatic flow is instructive.
In this case u2 = u1 as before, but SG = 0. The entropy balance then shows that
T2 = T1, in which case the energy balance yields P2 = P1. We conclude that the
temperature increase of (b) and the pressure decrease of (c) originate from flow
irreversibilities, specifically from the irreversibilities associated with fluid friction.

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes

Nozzles
The limitations observed for flow of compressible fluids in pipes do not extend to properly
designed nozzles, which bring about the interchange of internal and kinetic energy of a fluid
as a result of changing cross-sectional area available for flow. The design of effective nozzles
is a problem in fluid mechanics, but the flow through a well-designed nozzle is susceptible to
thermodynamic analysis. In a properly designed nozzle the area changes with length in such a
way as to make the flow nearly frictionless. In the limit of reversible flow, the rate of entropy
increase approaches zero, and dS/dx = 0. In this event Eqs. (7.9) and (7.10) become:

Thus, for subsonic flow in a converging nozzle, the velocity increases and the pressure
decreases as the cross-sectional area diminishes. The maximum obtainable fluid velocity is
the speed of sound, reached at the exit. Because of this, a converging subsonic nozzle can be
used to deliver a constant flow rate into a region of variable pressure. Suppose a compressible
fluid enters a converging nozzle at pressure P1 and discharges from the nozzle into a
chamber of variable pressure P2. As this discharge pressure decreases below P1, the flow rate
and velocity increase. Ultimately, the pressure ratio P2 /P1 reaches a critical value at which the
velocity at the nozzle exit is sonic. Further reduction in P2 has no effect on the conditions in
the nozzle. The flow remains constant, and the velocity at the nozzle exit is sonic, regardless
of the value of P2 /P1, provided it is always less than the critical value. For steam, the critical
value of this ratio is about 0.55 at moderate temperatures and pressures.
Supersonic velocities are readily attained in the diverging section of a properly designed
converging/diverging nozzle (Fig. 7.1). With sonic velocity reached at the throat, a further
increase in velocity and decrease in pressure requires an increase in cross-sectional area,
a diverging section to accommodate increasing volume of flow. The transition occurs at
the throat, where dA/dx = 0. The relationships between velocity, area, and pressure in a
converging/diverging nozzle are illustrated numerically in Ex. 7.2.

271

7.1. Duct Flow of Compressible Fluids

Figure 7.1:
Converging/diverging
nozzle.

The speed of sound is attained at the throat of a converging/diverging nozzle only
when the pressure at the throat is low enough that the critical value of P2 /P1 is reached.
If insufficient pressure drop is available in the nozzle for the velocity to become sonic,
the diverging section of the nozzle acts as a diffuser. That is, after the throat is reached, the
pressure rises and the velocity decreases; this is the conventional behavior for subsonic flow
in diverging sections. Of course, even when P2 /P1 is low enough to achieve choked flow, the
velocity cannot continue to increase indefinitely. Ultimately, it will return to subsonic velocity
across a shock wave. As P2 /P1 decreases, the location of this shock wave will move down
the nozzle, away from the throat, until the shock is outside the nozzle and the flow exiting
the nozzle is supersonic.
The relation of velocity to pressure in an isentropic nozzle can be expressed analytically
for the ideal-gas state and constant heat capacities. Combination of Eqs. (6.9) and (7.3) for
isentropic flow gives:

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes

Example 7.2
A high-velocity nozzle is designed to operate with steam at 700 kPa and 300°C.
At the nozzle inlet the velocity is 30 m⋅s−1. Calculate values of the ratio A/A1 (where A1
is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle inlet) for the sections where the pressure is
600, 500, 400, 300, and 200 kPa. Assume that the nozzle operates isentropically.

Solution 7.2
The required area ratios are determined by conservation of mass [Eq. (2.26)], and
the velocity u is found from the integrated form of Eq. (7.3), a steady-state energy

consistent with these, because 1 J = 1 kg⋅m2⋅s−2, and 1 J⋅kg−1 = 1 m2⋅s−2.
Initial values for entropy, enthalpy, and specific volume are obtained from the
steam tables:
S1 = 7.2997 kJ⋅kg−1⋅K−1  H1 = 3059.8 kJ⋅kg−1

process is a pressure drop in the fluid. Such a throttling process produces no shaft work, and
in the absence of heat transfer, Eq. (2.31) reduces to
ΔH = 0   or   H2 = H1
The process therefore occurs at constant enthalpy.
Because enthalpy in the ideal-gas state depends on temperature only, a throttling process
does not change the temperature in this state. For most real gases at moderate conditions of
temperature and pressure, a reduction in pressure at constant enthalpy results in a decrease
in temperature. For example, if steam at 1000 kPa and 300°C is throttled to 101.325 kPa
(atmospheric pressure),
H2 = H1 = 3052.1 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​
Interpolation in the steam tables at this enthalpy and at a pressure of 101.325 kPa
indicates a downstream temperature of 288.8°C. The temperature has decreased, but the
effect is small.
Throttling of wet steam to sufficiently low pressure causes the liquid to evaporate
and the vapor to become superheated. Thus if wet steam at 1000 kPa (t sat = 179.88°C) with a
quality of 0.96 is throttled to 101.325 kPa,
H2 = H1 = (0.04)(762.6) + (0.96)(2776.2) = 2695.7 kJ⋅kg−1
At 101.325 kPa steam with this enthalpy has a temperature of 109.8°C; it is therefore superheated (t sat = 100°C). The considerable temperature drop here results from evaporation of
liquid.
If a saturated liquid is throttled to a lower pressure, some of the liquid vaporizes or
flashes, producing a mixture of saturated liquid and saturated vapor at the lower pressure.
Thus if saturated liquid water at 1000 kPa (t sat = 179.88°C) is flashed to 101.325 kPa
(t sat = 100°C),
H2 = H1 = 762.6 kJ⋅kg−1
At 101.325 kPa the quality of the resulting steam is found from Eq. (6.96a) with M = H:
762.6 = (1 − x)(419.1) + x(2676.0)
= 419.1 + x(2676.0 − 419.1)
Hence	​
x = 0.152​	
Thus 15.2% of the original liquid vaporizes in the process. Again, the large temperature
drop results from evaporation of liquid. Throttling processes find frequent application in
refrigeration (Chap. 9).

Example 7.4
Propane gas at 20 bar and 400 K is throttled in a steady-state flow process to 1 bar.
Estimate the final temperature of the propane and its entropy change. Properties of
propane can be found from suitable generalized correlations.

Solution 7.4
To begin, we write the overall enthalpy change as the sum of three components:
(1) removal of residual enthalpy at state 1, (2) sensible heat to take the substance
from the ideal-gas state at the initial temperature to the ideal-gas state at the final
temperature, and (3) adding the residual enthalpy at state 2. These must sum to
zero for this constant-enthalpy process:
ig

ΔH = −​​H​  R1​  ​​ + ​​⟨​​​​​C​  P​  ​​​​⟩​​​H  (T2 − T1) + ​​H​  R2​  ​​ = 0
If propane in its final state at 1 bar is assumed to be in its ideal-gas state, ​​H​  R2​  ​​ = 0,
and the preceding equation, solved for T2, becomes
​H​  R​  ​
T2 = ______

​​
⟨​ ​​​C​  P​  ⟩​​ H
For propane,   Tc = 369.8 K

At these conditions the generalized correlation based on second virial coefficients
is satisfactory (Fig. 3.13), and calculation of ​​H​  R1​  ​​by Eqs. (6.68), (3.61), (6.70),
(3.62), and (6.71) is represented by:

and
​​H​  R1​  ​​ = (8.314)(369.8)(−0.452) = −1390 J⋅mol−1

The only remaining quantity in Eq. (A) to be evaluated is ​​⟨​​​​​C​  P​  ​​​​⟩​​​H. Data for

From Eq. (A),	​
​T​2​= ______

This gives:	​​〈​C​  P​  ​〉​  H​​ = 92.73 J⋅mol−1​⋅K​​−1​​

The positive value reflects the irreversibility of throttling processes.

Example 7.5
Throttling a real gas from conditions of moderate temperature and pressure usually
results in a temperature decrease. Under what conditions would an increase in
temperature be expected?

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes

TURBINES (EXPANDERS)

The expansion of a gas in a nozzle to produce a high-velocity stream is a process that
converts internal energy into kinetic energy, which in turn is converted into shaft work
when the stream impinges on blades attached to a rotating shaft. Thus a turbine (or expander)
consists of alternate sets of nozzles and rotating blades through which vapor or gas flows
in a steady-state expansion process. The overall result is the conversion of the internal energy
of a high-pressure stream into shaft work. When steam provides the motive force as in
most power plants, the device is called a turbine; when it is a high-pressure gas, such as
ammonia or ethylene in a chemical plant, the device is usually called an expander. The
process is shown in Fig. 7.3.

Figure 7.3: Steady-state flow

.

Equations (2.30) and (2.31) are appropriate energy balances across an expander. However,
the potential-energy term can be omitted because there is little change in elevation. Moreover,
in any properly designed turbine, heat transfer is negligible and the inlet and exit pipes are sized
to make fluid velocities roughly equal. For those conditions, Eqs. (2.30) and (2.31) reduce to:
∙

​ ​  ​(​H​2​− ​H​1​)​​ (7.13)
​​​W​​  s​​ = ​m​ ΔH = m
∙

∙

​Ws​​= ΔH = ​H​2​− ​H​1​​

(7.14)

Usually, the inlet conditions T1 and P1 and the discharge pressure P2 are fixed. Thus in
Eq. (7.14) only H1 is known; both H2 and ​Ws​​ are unknown, and the energy balance equation
alone does not allow their calculation. However, if the fluid in the turbine expands reversibly
and adiabatically, the process is isentropic, and S2 = S1. This second equation fixes the final
state of the fluid and determines H2. For this special case, ​Ws​​is given by Eq. (7.14), written:
	​
​Ws​​​(​isentropic​)​= ​(​ΔH​)​S​​	

(7.15)

The shaft work ​|​Ws​​|​(isentropic) is the maximum that can be obtained from an adiabatic
turbine with given inlet conditions and given discharge pressure. Actual turbines produce less
work, because the actual expansion process is irreversible; we define a turbine efficiency as:
​Ws​​
​η ≡ ____________
​   ​
​Ws​​(​ ​isentropic​)​

279

7.2. Turbines (Expanders)

where ​Ws​​is the actual shaft work. By Eqs. (7.14) and (7.15),
ΔH
	​
η = ​______​​	
(7.16)
​(​ΔH​)​S​
Values of η often fall in the range from 0.7 to 0.8. The HS diagram of Fig. 7.4 illustrates an
actual expansion in a turbine and a reversible expansion for the same intake conditions and
the same discharge pressure. The reversible path is the dashed vertical (constant-entropy) line
from point 1 at intake pressure P1 to point 2′ at discharge pressure P2. The solid line, representing the actual irreversible path, starts at point 1 and terminates at point 2 on the isobar
for P2. Because the process is adiabatic, irreversibilities cause an increase in entropy of the
fluid, and the path is directed toward increasing entropy. The more irreversible the process, the
further point 2 lies to the right on the P2 isobar, and the lower the efficiency η of the process.

Example 7.6
A steam turbine with rated capacity of 56,400 kW (56,400 kJ·s−1) operates with steam
at inlet conditions of 8600 kPa and 500°C, and discharges into a condenser at a
pressure of 10 kPa. Assuming a turbine efficiency of 0.75, determine the state of
the steam at discharge and the mass rate of flow of the steam.

Solution 7.6
At the inlet conditions of 8600 kPa and 500°C, the steam tables provide:
​H​1​= 3391.6 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​   

​ ​S​1​= 6.6858 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​

If the expansion to 10 kPa is isentropic, then, ​S2′ = ​S​1​ = 6.6858 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​​.
Steam with this entropy at 10 kPa is wet. Applying the “lever rule” [Eq. (6.96b),
with M = S and ​x​v​= x2′​], the quality is obtained as follows:
S2′ = ​S​  l2​​  + x2′ (​S​  v2​​  − ​S​  l2 ​)​ 

280

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes
Then,  ​
6.6858 = 0.6493 + x2′​​(​8.1511 − 0.6493​)​   x2′ = 0.8047​
This is the quality (fraction vapor) of the discharge stream at point 2′. The enthalpy ​
H2′​is also given by Eq. (6.96b), written:
​H2′​= H
​​ ​  l2​​​  + ​x2′​(​​H​  v2​​​  − ​​H​  l2​​)​ 
Thus,  ​H2′​= 191.8 + (0.8047)(2584.8 − 191.8) = 2117.4 kJ⋅kg−1
(ΔH)S = ​H2′​− H1 = 2117.4 − 3391.6 = −1274.2 kJ⋅kg−1
and by Eq. (7.16),
​ΔH = η ​(​ΔH​)​S​= ​(​0.75​)​(​−1274.2​)​= −955.6 kJ⋅kg​​−1​
Whence,  ​
​H​2​= ​H​1​+ ΔH = 3391.6 − 955.6 = 2436.0 kJ⋅kg​​−1​
Thus the steam in its actual final state is also wet, with its quality given by:
​2436.0 = 191.8 + ​x​2​(​2584.8 − 191.8​)​   ​x​2​= 0.9378​
Then ​
​S​2​= 0.6493 + ​(​0.9378​)​(​8.1511 − 0.6493​)​= 7.6846 kJ⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​
This value may be compared with the initial value of S1 = 6.6858.
∙
The steam rate ​​m​​ is given by Eq. (7.13). For a work rate of 56,400 kJ⋅s−1,
∙

​​W​s = −56,400 = ​m​  ​(​2436.0 − 3391.6​)​

​m​= 59.02 kg⋅s​​−1​

Example 7.6 was solved with data from the steam tables. When a comparable set of
tables is not available for the working fluid, the generalized correlations of Sec. 6.4 may be
used in conjunction with Eqs. (6.74) and (6.75), as illustrated in the following example.

COMPRESSION PROCESSES

Just as expansion processes result in pressure reductions in a flowing fluid, so compression
processes bring about pressure increases. Compressors, pumps, fans, blowers, and vacuum
pumps are all devices designed for this purpose. They are vital for the transport of fluids, for
fluidization of particulate solids, for bringing fluids to the proper pressure for reaction or processing, etc. We are concerned here not with the design of such devices, but with specification
of energy requirements for steady-state compression causing an increase in fluid pressure.

Compressors
The compression of gases may be accomplished in equipment with rotating blades (like a
turbine operating in reverse) or in cylinders with reciprocating pistons. Rotary equipment
is used for high-volume flow where the discharge pressure is not too high. For high pressures, reciprocating compressors are often required. The energy equations are independent of
the type of equipment; indeed, they are the same as for turbines or expanders because
here, too, potential and kinetic-energy changes are presumed negligible. Thus, Eqs. (7.13)
through (7.15) apply to adiabatic compression, a process represented by Fig. 7.5.

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes

In a compression process, the isentropic work, as given by Eq. (7.15), is the minimum
shaft work required for compression of a gas from a given initial state to a given discharge
pressure. Thus we define a compressor efficiency as:
​Ws​​(​ ​isentropic​)​
​η ≡ ​____________
   ​
​Ws​​
In view of Eqs. (7.14) and (7.15), this is also given by:
​(ΔH)​S​
	​
η ≡ ______
​
​​	
ΔH

(7.17)

Compressor efficiencies are usually in the range of 0.7 to 0.8.

The compression process is shown on an HS diagram in Fig. 7.6. The vertical dashed
line rising from point 1 to point 2′ represents the reversible adiabatic (constant-entropy)
compression process from P1 to P2. The actual irreversible compression process follows
the solid line from point 1 upward and to the right in the direction of increasing entropy,
terminating at point 2. The more irreversible the process, the further this point lies to the right
on the P2 isobar, and the lower the efficiency η of the process.

Example 7.8
Saturated-vapor steam at 100 kPa (t sat = 99.63°C) is compressed adiabatically to
300 kPa. If the compressor efficiency is 0.75, what is the work required and what are
the properties of the discharge stream?

285

7.3. Compression Processes

Solution 7.8
For saturated steam at 100 kPa,
​S​1​= 7.3598 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​

   ​H​1​= 2675.4 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​

For isentropic compression to 300 kPa, S​ 2′ = ​S​1​ = 7.3598 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​​. Interpolation in the tables for superheated steam at 300 kPa shows that steam with this
entropy has the enthalpy: ​H2′ = 2888.8 kJ⋅kg​​−1​​.
Thus,	​
​(​ΔH​)​S​= 2888.8 − 2675.4 = 213.4 kJ⋅kg​​−1​​	
​(​ΔH​)​S​ _____

By Eq. (7.17),	​​(​ΔH​)​= ______

η

and	​
​H​2​= ​H​1​+ ΔH = 2675.4 + 284.5 = 2959.9 kJ⋅kg​​−1​​	
For superheated steam with this enthalpy, interpolation yields:
​T​2​= 246.1°C​

​S​2​= 7.5019 ​kJ⋅kg​​−1​⋅K​​−1​

Moreover, by Eq. (7.14), the work required is:
​Ws​​= ΔH = 284.5 kJ⋅kg​​−1​

The direct application of Eqs. (7.13) through (7.15) presumes the availability of
tables of data or an equivalent thermodynamic diagram for the fluid being compressed.
Where such information is not available, the generalized correlations of Sec. 6.4 may be
used in conjunction with Eqs. (6.74) and (6.75), exactly as illustrated in Ex. 7.7 for an
expansion process.
The assumption of the ideal-gas state leads to relatively simple equations. By Eq. (5.14):
​T​2​
​P​2​
​ΔS = ​〈​CP​ ​〉​S​ln ___
​ ​− R ln ___
​ ​
​T​1​
​P​1​
where for simplicity the superscript ig has been omitted from the mean heat capacity. If the
compression is isentropic, ΔS = 0, and this equation becomes:

with T
​ 2′​the temperature that results when compression from T1 and P1 to P2 is isentropic and
where ​〈CP′〉​S​is the mean heat capacity for the temperature range from T1 to ​T2′​.
Applied to isentropic compression, Eq. (4.10) here becomes:
​(​ΔH​)​S​= ​〈CP′〉​H​​(​T2′ − ​T​1​)​
In accord with Eq. (7.15),	​​Ws​ ​(​isentropic​)​= ​⟨​CP′​⟩​H ​(T2′ − T1)​	

(7.19)

This result may be combined with the compressor efficiency to give:
​W​S (​ ​isentropic​)​

​W​S​= _____________

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes

The actual discharge temperature T2 resulting from compression is also found from Eq. (4.10),
rewritten as:
​ΔH = ​〈​CP​ ​〉​H ​(​T​2​− ​T​1​)​
ΔH
Whence,	​
​T​2​= ​T​1​+ ________
​

​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​

(7.21)

where by Eq. (7.14) ΔH = Ws. Here ​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​is the mean heat capacity for the temperature range
from T1 to T2.
For the special case of the ideal-gas state and constant heat capacities,
​⟨​CP′​⟩​H​= ​⟨​​CP​ ​⟩​H​= ​⟨​CP′​⟩​S​= ​CP​ ​
Equations (7.18) and (7.19) therefore become:
P2 R/CP
​T2′​= T1 ​​​ ​ ___ ​ ​​​  ​​   and

Ws (isentropic) = ​CP​ ​(​T2′ − ​T​1​)​

Combining these equations gives:4

For monatomic gases, such as argon and helium, R/CP = 2/5 = 0.4. For such diatomic
gases as oxygen, nitrogen, and air at moderate temperatures, R/CP ≈ 2/7 = 0.2857. For gases
of greater molecular complexity the ideal-gas heat capacity depends more strongly on temperature, and Eq. (7.22) is less likely to be suitable. One can easily show that the assumption of
constant heat capacities also leads to the result:
T2′ − ​T​1​

7.3. Compression Processes

Solution 7.9
Application of Eq. (7.18) requires evaluation of the exponent R /​​⟨​CP′​⟩​S​. This is

where the constants for methane are from Table C.1 of App. C. Choose a value
for ​T2′​somewhat higher than the initial temperature T1 = 293.15 K. The exponent
in Eq. (7.18) is the reciprocal of ​⟨​ ​CP′​⟩​S​​  /R. With P2 /P1 = 560/140 = 4.0 and
T1 = 293.15 K, find a new value of ​T2′​. The procedure is repeated until no further

Whence,   ​
​⟨​CP′​⟩​H​ = ​(​4.5774​)​(​8.314​)​= 38.506 J⋅mol​​−1​⋅K​​−1​​	
Then by Eq. (7.19),
​Ws​ ​(​isentropic​)​= ​(​38.056​)​(​397.37 − 293.15​)​= 3966.2 J⋅mol​​−1​
The actual work is found from Eq. (7.20):

​Ws​​= ______

Because ​〈​CP​ ​〉​H​ depends on T2, we again iterate. With ​T​2′​​as a starting value, this
leads to the results:
​T​2​= 428.65 K​

CHAPTER 7. Applications of Thermodynamics to Flow Processes

Pumps
Liquids are usually moved by pumps, which are generally rotating equipment. The same
equations apply to adiabatic pumps as to adiabatic compressors. Thus, Eqs. (7.13) through
(7.15) and Eq. (7.17) are valid. However, application of Eq. (7.14) for the calculation of​
W​s​​= ΔH requires values of the enthalpy of compressed (subcooled) liquids, and these
are seldom available. The fundamental property relation, Eq. (6.9), provides an alternative.
For an isentropic process,
​dH = V dP

​(​const S  ​)​

Combining this with Eq. (7.15) yields:
P2

​Ws​​(​isentropic​)​= ​(​ΔH​)​S​= ​ ​  ​ ​V dP​
∫ P1
The usual assumption for liquids (at conditions well removed from the critical point) is that
V is independent of P. Integration then gives:
	​
​Ws​ ​(​isentropic​)​= ​(​ΔH​)​S​= V​​(​​P​2​− ​P​1​)​​	

(7.24)

Also useful are the following equations from Chap. 6:
​dH = ​CP​ ​ dT + V​​(​1 − βT ​)​dP​ (6.27)

dT
​dS = ​CP​ ​___
​ ​ − βV dP​
T

(6.28)

where the volume expansivity β is defined by Eq. (3.3). Because temperature changes in
the pumped fluid are very small and because the properties of liquids are insensitive to
pressure (again at conditions not close to the critical point), these equations are usually
integrated on the assumption that CP, V, and β are constant, usually at initial values. Thus,
to a good approximation
​ΔH = ​CP​ ​ΔT + V​​(​1 − βT ​)​ΔP​ (7.25)

​T​2​
​ΔS = ​CP​ ​ln ___

of 8600 kPa. Assume the pump efficiency to be 0.75. Calculate the work of the pump,
the temperature change of the water, and the entropy change of the water.

The following are properties for saturated liquid water at 45°C (318.15 K):

Production of Power from Heat

In everyday experience, we often speak of “using” energy. For example, one’s utility bills
are determined by the quantities of electrical energy and chemical energy (e.g. natural gas)
“used” in one’s home. This may appear to conflict with the conservation of energy expressed
by the first law of thermodynamics. However, closer examination shows that when we speak
of “using” energy, we generally mean the conversion of energy from a form capable of producing mechanical work into heat and/or transfer of heat from a source at higher temperature to
a lower temperature. These processes that “use” energy in fact are ones that generate entropy.
Such entropy generation is inevitable. However, we “use” energy most efficiently when we
minimize entropy generation.
Except for nuclear power, the sun is the ultimate source of almost all mechanical and
electrical power used by humankind. Energy reaches the earth by solar radiation at a tremendous rate, exceeding current total rates of human energy use by orders of magnitude. Of course
the same amount of energy radiates into space from the earth, such that the earth’s temperature
remains nearly constant. However, incoming solar radiation has an effective temperature near
6000 K, twenty times that of the earth. This large temperature difference implies that most of
the incoming solar radiation can, in principle, be converted to mechanical or electrical power.
Of course, a key role of sunlight is to support the growth of vegetation. Over millions of years
a fraction of this organic matter has been transformed into deposits of coal, oil, and natural gas. Combustion of these fossil fuels provided the power needed to enable the Industrial
Revolution and to transform civilization. The large-scale power plants that dot the landscape
depend on combustion of these fuels, and to a lesser extent on nuclear fission, for the transfer
of heat to the working fluid (H2O) of steam power plants. These are large-scale heat engines
that convert part of the heat into mechanical energy. As a consequence of the second law, the
thermal efficiencies of these plants seldom exceed 35%.
Water evaporated by sunlight and transported over land by wind is the source of precipitation that ultimately produces hydroelectric power on a significant scale. Solar radiation also
energizes atmospheric winds, which in favorable locations are increasingly used to drive large
wind turbines for the production of power. As fossil fuels become less readily available and
more expensive, and with increasing concern about atmospheric pollution and global warming, development of alternative sources of power has become urgent. An especially attractive means of harnessing solar energy is through photovoltaic cells, which convert radiation
directly into electricity. They are safe, simple, durable, and operate at ambient temperatures,

CHAPTER 8. Production of Power from Heat

but expense has largely limited their use to small-scale special applications. Their future use
on a much larger scale seems inevitable, and the photovoltaic industry is growing at a rapid
pace. An alternative for harnessing solar energy at large scales is solar-thermal technology, in
which sunlight is focused with mirrors to heat a working fluid that drives a heat engine.
A common device for the direct conversion of chemical (molecular) energy into
electrical energy, without the intermediate generation of heat, is the electrochemical cell, that
is, a battery. A related device is the fuel cell, in which reactants are supplied continuously to
the electrodes. The prototype is a cell in which hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water
through electrochemical conversion. The efficiency of conversion of chemical to electrical
energy is considerably improved over processes that first convert chemical energy into heat
by combustion. This technology has potential application in transportation, and may well find
other uses.
The internal-combustion engine is also a heat engine, wherein high temperatures are
attained by conversion of the chemical energy of a fuel directly into internal energy within the
work-producing device. Examples are Otto, Diesel, and gas-turbine engines.1
In this chapter we briefly analyze:
∙ Steam power plants in relation to the Carnot, Rankine, and regenerative cycles
∙ Internal-combustion engines in relation to the Otto, Diesel, and Brayton cycles
∙ Jet and rocket engines

8.1

THE STEAM POWER PLANT

Figure 8.1 shows a simple steady-state steady-flow cyclic process in which steam generated
in a boiler is expanded in an adiabatic turbine to produce work. The discharge stream from
the turbine passes to a condenser from which it is pumped adiabatically back to the boiler.
The processes that occur as the working fluid flows around the cycle are represented by lines
on the TS diagram of Fig. 8.2. The sequence of these lines conforms to a Carnot cycle, as
described in Chapter 5. The operation as represented is reversible, consisting of two isothermal steps connected by two adiabatic steps.
Step 1 → 2 is isothermal vaporization taking place
in a boiler at temperature TH, wherein
∙
heat is transferred to saturated-liquid water at rate Q
​​​ ​​  H​​​, producing saturated vapor. Step 2 → 3
is reversible adiabatic expansion of saturated vapor in a turbine producing a two-phase mixture
of saturated liquid and vapor at TC. This isentropic expansion is represented by a vertical line.
Step 3 → 4 is an isothermal partial-condensation
process at lower temperature TC , wherein
∙
heat is transferred to the surroundings at rate Q
​​​ ​​  C​​​. Step 4 → 1 is an isentropic compression in a
pump. Represented by a vertical line, it takes the cycle back to∙ its origin, producing s­ aturatedliquid water at point 1. The power produced by the turbine ​​​W​​  turbine​​​is much greater than the

Clearly, η increases as TH increases and as TC decreases. Although the efficiencies of practical
heat engines are lowered by irreversibilities, it is still true that their efficiencies are increased
when the average temperature at which heat is absorbed in the boiler is increased and when the
average temperature at which heat is rejected in the condenser is decreased.

The Rankine Cycle
The thermal efficiency of the Carnot cycle just described and given by Eq. (5.7) could serve as
a standard of comparison for actual steam power plants. However, severe practical difficulties
attend the operation of equipment intended to carry out steps 2 → 3 and 4 → 1. Turbines that

302

CHAPTER 8. Production of Power from Heat

take in saturated steam produce an exhaust with high liquid content, which causes severe erosion problems.2 Even more difficult is the design of a pump that takes in a mixture of liquid
and vapor (point 4) and discharges a saturated liquid (point 1). For these reasons, an alternative cycle is taken as the standard, at least for fossil-fuel-burning power plants. It is called the
Rankine cycle, and it differs from the cycle of Fig. 8.2 in two major respects. First, the heating
step 1 → 2 is carried well beyond vaporization so as to produce a superheated vapor, and second, the cooling step 3 → 4 brings about complete condensation, yielding saturated liquid to
be pumped to the boiler. The Rankine cycle therefore consists of the four steps shown in­
Fig. 8.3 and described as follows:
∙ 1 → 2 A constant-pressure heating process in a boiler. The step lies along an isobar
(the pressure of the boiler) and consists of three sections: heating of subcooled liquid
water to its saturation temperature, vaporization at constant temperature and pressure,
and superheating of the vapor to a temperature well above its saturation temperature.
∙ 2 → 3 Reversible, adiabatic (isentropic) expansion of vapor in a turbine to the pressure of the condenser. The step normally crosses the saturation curve, producing a wet
exhaust. However, the superheating accomplished in step 1 → 2 shifts the vertical line
far enough to the right on Fig. 8.3 that the moisture content is not too large.
∙ 3 → 4 A constant-pressure, constant-temperature process in a condenser to produce saturated liquid at point 4.
∙ 4 → 1 Reversible, adiabatic (isentropic) pumping of the saturated liquid to the pressure
of the boiler, producing compressed (subcooled) liquid. The vertical line (whose length
is exaggerated in Fig 8.3) is very short because the temperature rise associated with
compression of a liquid is small.
Power plants actually operate on a cycle that departs from the Rankine cycle due to
irreversibilities of the expansion and compression steps. Figure 8.4 illustrates the effects of
these irreversibilities on steps 2 → 3 and 4 → 1. The lines are no longer vertical but tend in the
direction of increasing entropy. The turbine exhaust is normally still wet, but with sufficiently

low moisture content, erosion problems are not serious. Slight subcooling of the condensate in
the condenser may occur, but the effect is inconsequential.
The boiler serves to transfer heat from a burning fuel (or from a nuclear reactor or even
a solar-thermal heat source) to the cycle, and the condenser transfers heat from the cycle to the
surroundings. Neglecting kinetic- and potential-energy changes reduces the energy relations,

Turbine and pump calculations were treated in detail in Secs. 7.2 and 7.3.

Example 8.1
Steam generated in a power plant at a pressure of 8600 kPa and a temperature of
500°C is fed to a turbine. Exhaust from the turbine enters a condenser at 10 kPa,
where it is condensed to saturated liquid, which is then pumped to the boiler.
(a) What is the thermal efficiency of a Rankine cycle operating at these conditions?
(b) What is the thermal efficiency of a practical cycle operating at these conditions
if the turbine efficiency and pump efficiency are both 0.75?
(c) If the rating of the power cycle of part (b) is 80,000 kW, what is the steam rate
and what are the heat-transfer rates in the boiler and condenser?

Solution 8.1
(a) The turbine operates under the same conditions as the turbine of Ex. 7.6 where,
on the basis of 1 kg of steam:

Moreover, the enthalpy at the end of isentropic expansion, ​​H​ 2′ ​​​  in Ex. 7.6, is here:

Subscripts refer to Fig. 8.4. The enthalpy of saturated liquid condensate at 10 kPa
(and ​t​sat​= 45.83° C​) is:

​H​4​= 191.8 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
By Eq. (8.2) applied to the condenser,
	​
Q(condenser) = ​H​ 4​​ − ​H3′​  ​​  = 191.8 − 2117.4 = − 1925.6 kJ⋅kg−1​​	
where the minus sign indicates heat flow out of the system.
	  The pump operates under essentially the same conditions as the pump of
Ex. 7.10, where:
	​
​Ws​​(isentropic) = ​(​ΔH​)​S​= 8.7 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
and	​​H​1​= ​H​4​+ ​(​ΔH​)​S​= 191.8 + 8.7 = 200.5 kJ⋅kg​​−1​
The enthalpy of superheated steam at 8,600 kPa and 500°C is:
	​
​H​2​= 3391.6 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
By Eq. (8.2) applied to the boiler,
	​
Q(boiler) = ​H​2​− ​H​1​= 3391.6 − 200.5 = 3191.1 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
The net work of the Rankine cycle is the sum of the turbine work and the pump work:
	​
​Ws​​(Rankine) = −1274.2 + 8.7 = −1265.5 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
This result is of course also:

​Ws​​(pump) = ΔH = 11.6 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
The net work of the cycle is therefore:

The Regenerative Cycle
The thermal efficiency of a steam power cycle is increased when the pressure and hence the
vaporization temperature in the boiler is raised. It is also increased by greater superheating
in the boiler. Thus, high boiler pressures and temperatures favor high efficiencies. However,
these same conditions increase the capital investment in the plant, because they require heavier construction and more expensive materials of construction. Moreover, these costs increase
ever more rapidly as more severe conditions are imposed. Thus, in practice power plants seldom operate at pressures much above 10,000 kPa or temperatures much above 600°C. The
thermal efficiency of a power plant increases as pressure and hence temperature in the condenser is reduced. However, condensation temperatures must be higher than the temperature
of the cooling medium, usually water, and this is controlled by local conditions of climate and
geography. Power plants universally operate with condenser pressures as low as practical.
Most modern power plants operate on a modification of the Rankine cycle that incorporates feedwater heaters. Water from the condenser, rather than being pumped directly back
to the boiler, is first heated by steam extracted from the turbine. This is normally done in
several stages, with steam taken from the turbine at several intermediate states of expansion.
An arrangement with four feedwater heaters is shown in Fig. 8.5. The operating conditions
indicated on this figure and described in the following paragraphs are typical, and are the basis
for the illustrative calculations of Ex. 8.2.

Figure 8.5: Steam power plant with feedwater heating.

The conditions of steam generation in the boiler are the same as in Ex. 8.1: 8600 kPa
and 500°C. The exhaust pressure of the turbine, 10 kPa, is also the same. The saturation temperature of the exhaust steam is therefore 45.83°C. Allowing for slight subcooling of the condensate, we fix the temperature of the liquid water from the condenser at 45°C. The feedwater
pump, which operates under exactly the conditions of the pump in Ex. 7.10, causes a temperature rise of about 1°C, making the temperature of the feedwater entering the series of heaters
equal to 46°C.
The saturation temperature of steam at the boiler pressure of 8600 kPa is 300.06°C, and
the temperature to which the feedwater can be raised in the heaters is certainly less. This temperature is a design variable, which is ultimately fixed by economic considerations. However,
a value must be chosen before any thermodynamic calculations can be made. We have therefore arbitrarily specified a temperature of 226°C for the feedwater stream entering the boiler.
We have also specified that all four feedwater heaters accomplish the same temperature rise.
Thus, the total temperature rise of 226 – 46 = 180°C is divided into four 45°C increments.
This establishes all intermediate feedwater temperatures at the values shown on Fig. 8.5.
The steam supplied to a given feedwater heater must be at a pressure high enough
that its saturation temperature is above that of the feedwater stream leaving the heater. We
have here presumed a minimum temperature difference for heat transfer of no less than 5°C,
and have chosen extraction steam pressures such that the tsat values shown in the feedwater
heaters are at least 5°C greater than the exit temperatures of the feedwater streams. The
condensate from each feedwater heater is flashed through a throttle valve to the heater at the

307

8.1. The Steam Power Plant

next lower pressure, and the collected condensate in the final heater of the series is flashed
into the condenser. Thus, all condensate returns from the condenser to the boiler by way of
the feedwater heaters.
The purpose of heating the feedwater in this manner is to raise the average temperature
at which heat is added to the water in the boiler. This increases the thermal efficiency of the
plant, which is said to operate on a regenerative cycle.

Example 8.2
Determine the thermal efficiency of the power plant shown in Fig. 8.5, assuming
turbine and pump efficiencies of 0.75. If its power rating is 80,000 kW, what is
the steam rate from the boiler and what are the heat-transfer rates in the boiler
and condenser?

Solution 8.2
Initial calculations are made on the basis of 1 kg of steam entering the turbine
from the boiler. The turbine is in effect divided into five sections, as indicated in
Fig. 8.5. Because steam is extracted at the end of each section, the flow rate in the
turbine decreases from one section to the next. The amounts of steam extracted
from the first four sections are determined by energy balances.
This requires enthalpies of the compressed feedwater streams. The effect of
pressure at constant temperature on a liquid is given by Eq. (7.25):
	​ΔH = V(1 − βT )ΔP​

(​ ​const T )​ ​​	

For saturated liquid water at 226°C (499.15 K), the steam tables provide:
	​
​P​sat​= 2598.2 kPa H = 971.5 kJ⋅kg​​−1

V = 1201 ​cm​​3​⋅kg​​−1​	

In addition, at this temperature,
	​
β = 1.582 × ​10​​−3​ K−1​	
Thus, for a pressure change from the saturation pressure to 8600 kPa:
(8600 − 2598.2)
______________
ΔH = 1201[1 − (1.528 × 10−3) (499.15)]​   
 ​ = 1.5 kJ⋅kg​​−1​
​10​​  6​
​	

H = H (sat. liq.) + ΔH = 971.5 + 1.5 = 973.0 kJ⋅kg​​−1​

and	​	

Similar calculations yield the enthalpies of the feedwater at other temperatures.

The first section of the turbine and the first feedwater heater, are shown by
Fig. 8.6. The enthalpy and entropy of the steam entering the turbine are found
from the tables for superheated steam. The assumption of isentropic expansion of
steam in section I of the turbine to 2900 kPa leads to the result:
	​
​(ΔH )​S​= − 320.5 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
If we assume that the turbine efficiency is independent of the pressure to which
the steam expands, then Eq. (7.16) gives:
	​ΔH = η ​(​ΔH​)​S​= ​(​0.75​)​(​−320.5​)​= − 240.4 kJ⋅kg​​−1​	
By Eq. (7.14),
	​
​Ws​​(​I​)​= ΔH = − 240.4 kJ​	
In addition, the enthalpy of steam discharged from this section of the turbine is:
	​
H = 3391.6 − 240.4 = 3151.2 kJ⋅kg​​−1​

For each kilogram of steam entering the turbine, 1−m is the mass of steam flowing into section II of the turbine.
Section II of the turbine and the second feedwater heater are shown in Fig. 8.7.
In doing the same calculations as for section I, we assume that each kilogram of
steam leaving section II expands from its state at the turbine entrance to the exit
of section II with an efficiency of 0.75 compared with isentropic expansion. The
enthalpy of the steam leaving section II found in this way is:
H = 2987.8 kJ⋅kg−1
Then on the basis of 1 kg of steam entering the turbine,
	​
​Ws​​(​II​)​= ​(​2987.8 − 3151.2​)​(​0.90626​)​= − 148.08 kJ​

Thus for every kilogram of steam entering the turbine, the work produced is

heaters. The work required by the pump is exactly the work calculated for the
pump in Ex. 7.10, that is, 11.6 kJ. The net work of the cycle on the basis of 1 kg of
steam generated in the boiler is therefore:

​Ws​​(net) = − 804.0 + 11.6 = −792.4 kJ​	
On the same basis, the heat added in the boiler is:

Although the steam generation rate is higher than was found in Ex. 8.1, the
heat-transfer rates in the boiler and condenser are appreciably less because their
functions are partly taken over by the feedwater heaters.

8.2

INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINES

In a steam power plant, the steam is an inert medium to which heat is transferred from an
external source (e.g., burning fuel). It is therefore characterized by large heat-transfer
­surfaces: (1) for the absorption of heat by the steam at a high temperature in the boiler, and
(2) for the rejection of heat from the steam at a relatively low temperature in the condenser.
The disadvantage is that when heat must be transferred through walls (as through the metal
walls of boiler tubes) the ability of the walls to withstand high temperatures and pressures
imposes a limit on the temperature of heat absorption. In an internal-combustion engine, on
the other hand, a fuel is burned within the engine itself, and the combustion products serve
as the working medium, acting for example on a piston in a cylinder. High temperatures are
internal and do not involve heat-transfer surfaces.
Burning of fuel within the internal-combustion engine complicates thermodynamic
analysis. Moreover, fuel and air flow steadily into an internal-combustion engine, and combustion products flow steadily out of it; no working medium undergoes a cyclic process, as
does steam in a steam power plant. However, for making simple analyses, one imagines cyclic
engines with air as the working fluid, equivalent in performance to actual internal-combustion
engines. In addition, the combustion step is replaced by the addition to the air of an equivalent
amount of heat. In what follows, each internal-combustion engine is introduced by a qualitative description. This is followed by a quantitative analysis of an ideal cycle in which air in its
ideal-gas state with constant heat capacities is the working medium.

The Otto Engine
The most common internal-combustion engine, because of its use in automobiles, is the Otto
engine.3 Its cycle consists of four strokes and starts with an intake stroke at essentially constant
pressure, during which a piston moving outward draws a fuel/air mixture into a cylinder. This is
represented by line 0 → 1 in Fig. 8.8. During the second stroke (1 → 2 → 3), all valves are closed,
and the fuel/air mixture is compressed, approximately adiabatically along line segment 1 → 2; the
mixture is then ignited, by firing of a spark plug, and combustion occurs so rapidly that the volume remains nearly constant while the pressure rises along line segment 2 → 3. It is during the
third stroke (3 → 4 → 1) that work is produced. The high-temperature, high-pressure products of
combustion expand, approximately adiabatically along line segment 3 → 4; the exhaust valve then
opens and the pressure falls rapidly at nearly constant volume along line segment 4 → 1. During
the fourth or exhaust stroke (line 1 → 0), the piston pushes the remaining combustion gases
(except for the contents of the clearance volume) from the cylinder. The volume plotted in Fig. 8.8
is the total volume of gas contained in the engine between the piston and the cylinder head.
3Named for Nikolaus August Otto, the German engineer who demonstrated one of the first practical engines of this
type. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus_Otto. Also called a four-stroke spark-ignition engine.

The effect of increasing the compression ratio—the ratio of the volumes at the beginning and end of compression from point 1 to point 2—is to increase the efficiency of the
engine, that is, to increase the work produced per unit quantity of fuel. We demonstrate this for
an idealized cycle, called the air-standard Otto cycle, shown in Fig. 8.9. It consists of two adiabatic and two constant-volume steps, which comprise a heat-engine cycle for which the working fluid is air in its ideal-gas state with constant heat capacity. Step CD, a reversible adiabatic
compression, is followed by step DA, where sufficient heat is added to the air at constant
volume to raise its temperature and pressure to the values resulting from combustion in an
actual Otto engine. Then the air is expanded adiabatically and reversibly (step AB) and cooled
at constant volume (step BC) to the initial state at C by heat transfer to the surroundings.

This equation shows that the thermal efficiency increases rapidly with the compression ratio r
at low values of r, but more slowly at high compression ratios. This agrees with the results of
actual tests on Otto engines.
Unfortunately, the compression ratio cannot be increased arbitrarily but is limited by
pre-ignition of the fuel. For sufficiently high compression ratios, the temperature rise due to
compression will ignite the fuel before the compression stroke is complete. This is manifested
as “knocking” of the engine. Compression ratios in automobile engines are usually not much
above 10. The compression ratio at which pre-ignition occurs depends on the fuel, with the
resistance to pre-ignition of fuels indicated by an octane rating. High-octane gasoline does
not actually contain more octane than other gasoline, but it does have additives such as alcohols, ethers, and aromatic compounds that increase its resistance to pre-ignition. Iso-octane is
arbitrarily assigned an octane number of 100, while n-heptane is assigned an octane number
of zero. Other compounds and fuels are assigned octane numbers relative to these standards,
based on the compression ratio at which they pre-ignite. Ethanol and methanol have octane
numbers well above 100. Racing engines that burn these alcohols can employ compression
ratios of 15 or more.

CHAPTER 8. Production of Power from Heat

The Diesel Engine
The fundamental difference between the Otto cycle and the Diesel cycle4 is that in the Diesel
cycle the temperature at the end of compression is sufficiently high that combustion is initiated spontaneously. This higher temperature results because of a higher compression ratio that
carries the compression step to a higher pressure. The fuel is not injected until the end of the
compression step, and then it is added slowly enough that the combustion process occurs at
approximately constant pressure.
For the same compression ratio, the Otto engine has a higher efficiency than the Diesel
engine. Because preignition limits the compression ratio attainable in the Otto engine, the
Diesel engine operates at higher compression ratios, and consequently at higher efficiencies.
Compression ratios can exceed 20 in Diesel engines employing indirect fuel injection.

Example 8.3
Sketch the air-standard Diesel cycle on a PV diagram, and derive an equation
giving the thermal efficiency of this cycle in relation to the compression ratio r (ratio
of ­volumes at the beginning and end of the compression step) and the expansion
ratio re (ratio of volumes at the end and beginning of the adiabatic expansion step).

Solution 8.3
The air-standard Diesel cycle is the same as the air-standard Otto cycle, except
that the heat-absorption step (corresponding to the combustion process in the
actual engine) is at constant pressure, as indicated by line DA in Fig. 8.10.

The Gas-Turbine Engine
The Otto and Diesel engines exemplify direct use of the energy of high-temperature, high-pressure
gases acting on a piston within a cylinder; no heat transfer with an external source is required.
However, turbines are more efficient than reciprocating engines, and the advantages of i­ nternal
combustion are combined with those of the turbine in the gas-turbine engine.
The gas turbine is driven by high-temperature gases from a combustion chamber, as
indicated in Fig. 8.11. The entering air is compressed (supercharged) to a pressure of several
bars before combustion. The centrifugal compressor operates on the same shaft as the turbine,
and part of the work of the turbine serves to drive the compressor. The higher the temperature

of the combustion gases entering the turbine, the higher the efficiency of the unit, i.e., the
greater the work produced per unit of fuel burned. The limiting temperature is determined by
the strength of the metal turbine blades and is generally much lower than the theoretical flame
temperature (Ex. 4.7) of the fuel. Sufficient excess air must be supplied to keep the combustion temperature at a safe level.
The idealization of the gas-turbine engine, called the Brayton cycle, is shown on a PV
diagram in Fig. 8.12. The working fluid is air in its ideal-gas state with constant heat capacities. Step AB is a reversible adiabatic compression from PA (atmospheric pressure) to PB. In
step BC heat QBC, replacing combustion, is added at constant pressure, raising the air temperature. A work-producing isentropic expansion of the air reduces the pressure from PC to PD

(a) Direct substitution in Eq. (8.12) gives the efficiency:

η = 1 − ​(​1 / 6​)​​(​1.4−1​)​∕1.4​= 1 − 0.60 = 0.40​	
(b) Irreversibilities in both the compressor and turbine reduce the thermal efficiency of the engine because the net work is the difference between the work
required by the compressor and the work produced by the turbine. The temperature of air entering the compressor TA and the temperature of air entering the
turbine, the specified maximum for TC , are the same as for the reversible cycle
of part (a). However, the temperature after irreversible compression in the compressor TB is higher than the temperature after isentropic compression ​​T​ B′ ​​​ , and
the temperature after irreversible expansion in the turbine TD is higher than the

the thermal efficiency (23.5%) is considerably reduced from the reversible-cycle
value of part (a) (40%).

8.3 JET ENGINES; ROCKET ENGINES
In the power cycles so far considered the high-temperature, high-pressure gas expands in a
turbine (steam power plant, gas turbine) or in the cylinders of an Otto or Diesel engine with
reciprocating pistons. In either case, the power becomes available through a rotating shaft.
Another device for expanding the hot gases is a nozzle. Here the power is available as kinetic
energy in the jet of exhaust gases leaving the nozzle. The entire power plant, consisting of a
compression device and a combustion chamber, as well as a nozzle, is known as a jet engine.
Because the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases is directly available for propelling the engine
and its attachments, jet engines are most commonly used to power aircraft. There are several
types of jet-propulsion engines based on different ways of accomplishing the compression and
expansion processes. Because the air striking the engine has kinetic energy (with respect to the
engine), its pressure may be increased in a diffuser.
The turbojet engine (usually called simply a jet engine) illustrated in Fig. 8.13 takes
advantage of a diffuser to reduce the work of compression. The axial-flow compressor completes

the job of compression, and then fuel is injected and burned in the combustion chamber. Hot
combustion-product gases first pass through a turbine where expansion provides just enough
power to drive the compressor. The remaining expansion to the exhaust pressure is accomplished
in the nozzle. Here, the velocity of the gases with respect to the engine is increased to a level
above that of the entering air. This increase in velocity provides a thrust (force) on the engine in
the forward direction. If the compression and expansion processes are adiabatic and reversible,
the turbojet engine follows the Brayton cycle shown in Fig. 8.12. The only differences are that,
physically, the compression and expansion steps are carried out in devices of different types.
A rocket engine differs from a jet engine in that the oxidizing agent is carried with the engine.
Instead of depending on the surrounding air to support combustion, the rocket is self-contained.
This means that the rocket can operate in a vacuum such as in outer space. In fact, the performance
is better in a vacuum because none of the thrust is required to overcome friction forces.
In rockets burning liquid fuels, the oxidizing agent (e.g., liquid oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide) is pumped from tanks into the combustion chamber. Simultaneously, fuel (e.g., hydrogen,
kerosene, or monomethylhydrazine) is pumped into the chamber and burned. The combustion
takes place at a constant high pressure and produces high-temperature product gases that are
expanded in a nozzle, as indicated in Fig. 8.14.

In rockets burning solid fuels, the fuel (e.g., organic polymers) and oxidizer (e.g.,
ammonium perchlorate) are contained together in a solid matrix and stored at the forward end
of the combustion chamber. Combustion and expansion are much the same as in a jet engine
(Fig. 8.13), but a solid-fuel rocket requires no compression work, and in a liquid-fuel rocket
the compression work is small because the fuel and oxidizer are pumped as liquids.

8.1. The basic cycle for a steam power plant is shown in Fig. 8.1. The turbine operates
adiabatically with inlet steam at 6800 kPa and 550°C, and the exhaust steam enters the
condenser at 50°C with a quality of 0.96. Saturated liquid water leaves the condenser
and is pumped to the boiler. Neglecting pump work and kinetic- and potential-energy
changes, determine the thermal efficiency of the cycle and the turbine efficiency.

8.4. Steam enters the turbine of a power plant operating on the Rankine cycle (Fig. 8.3) at
3300 kPa and exhausts at 50 kPa. To show the effect of superheating on the performance
of the cycle, calculate the thermal efficiency of the cycle and the quality of the exhaust

exhaust steam from the turbine for boiler pressures of 5000, 7500, and 10,000 kPa.
8.6. A steam power plant employs two adiabatic turbines in series. Steam enters the first
turbine at 650°C and 7000 kPa and discharges from the second turbine at 20 kPa. The
system is designed for equal power outputs from the two turbines, based on a turbine
efficiency of 78% for each turbine. Determine the temperature and pressure of the
steam in its intermediate state between the two turbines. What is the overall efficiency
of the two turbines together with respect to isentropic expansion of the steam from the
initial to the final state?
8.7. A steam power plant operating on a regenerative cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 8.5,
includes just one feedwater heater. Steam enters the turbine at 4500 kPa and 500°C
and exhausts at 20 kPa. Steam for the feedwater heater is extracted from the turbine
at 350 kPa, and in condensing raises the temperature of the feedwater to within 6°C
of its condensation temperature at 350 kPa. If the turbine and pump efficiencies are
both 0.78, what is the thermal efficiency of the cycle, and what fraction of the steam
entering the turbine is extracted for the feedwater heater?
8.8. A steam power plant operating on a regenerative cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 8.5,
includes just one feedwater heater. Steam enters the turbine at 650(psia) and 900(°F)
and exhausts at 1(psia). Steam for the feedwater heater is extracted from the turbine
at 50(psia) and in condensing raises the temperature of the feedwater to within 11(°F)
of its condensation temperature at 50(psia). If the turbine and pump efficiencies are
both 0.78, what is the thermal efficiency of the cycle, and what fraction of the steam
entering the turbine is extracted for the feedwater heater?

8.9. A steam power plant operating on a regenerative cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 8.5,
includes two feedwater heaters. Steam enters the turbine at 6500 kPa and 600°C and
exhausts at 20 kPa. Steam for the feedwater heaters is extracted from the turbine at
pressures such that the feedwater is heated to 190°C in two equal increments of temperature rise, with 5°C approaches to the steam-condensation temperature in each
feedwater heater. If the turbine and pump efficiencies are each 0.80, what is the thermal efficiency of the cycle, and what fraction of the steam entering the turbine is
extracted for each feedwater heater?
8.10. A power plant operating on heat recovered from the exhaust gases of internal combustion
engines uses isobutane as the working medium in a modified Rankine cycle in which
the upper pressure level is above the critical pressure of isobutane. Thus the isobutane
does not undergo a change of phase as it absorbs heat prior to its entry into the turbine.
Isobutane vapor is heated at 4800 kPa to 260°C and enters the turbine as a supercritical
fluid at these conditions. Isentropic expansion in the turbine produces a superheated
vapor at 450 kPa, which is cooled and condensed at constant pressure. The resulting
saturated liquid enters the pump for return to the heater. If the power output of the
modified Rankine cycle is 1000 kW, what are the isobutane flow rate, the heat-transfer
rates in the heater and condenser, and the thermal efficiency of the cycle? The vapor
pressure of isobutane can be computed from data given in Table B.2 of App. B.
8.11. A power plant operating on heat from a geothermal source uses isobutane as the
working medium in a Rankine cycle (Fig. 8.3). Isobutane is heated at 3400 kPa
(a pressure just below its critical pressure) to a temperature of 140°C, at which
conditions it enters the turbine. Isentropic expansion in the turbine produces
superheated vapor at 450 kPa, which is cooled and condensed to saturated liquid and
pumped to the heater/boiler. If the flow rate of isobutane is 75 kg⋅s−1, what is the
power output of the Rankine cycle, and what are the heat-transfer rates in the heater/
boiler and cooler/condenser? What is the thermal efficiency of the cycle? The vapor
pressure of isobutane is given in Table B.2 of App. B.
Repeat these calculations for a cycle in which the turbine and pump each have an
efficiency of 80%.

CHAPTER 8. Production of Power from Heat
(c) If γ = 1.4, how does the thermal efficiency of an air-standard Otto cycle with a
compression ratio of 8 compare with the thermal efficiency of an air-standard
Diesel cycle with the same compression ratio and a cutoff ratio of 2? How is the
comparison changed if the cutoff ratio is 3?

8.13. An air-standard Diesel cycle absorbs 1500 J⋅mol−1 of heat (step DA of Fig. 8.10,
which simulates combustion). The pressure and temperature at the beginning of the
compression step are 1 bar and 20°C, and the pressure at the end of the compression
step is 4 bar. Assuming air to be an ideal gas for which CP = (7/2)R and CV = (5/2)R,
what are the compression ratio and the expansion ratio of the cycle?
8.14. Calculate the efficiency for an air-standard gas-turbine cycle (the Brayton cycle) operating
with a pressure ratio of 3. Repeat for pressure ratios of 5, 7, and 9. Take γ = 1.35.
8.15. An air-standard gas-turbine cycle is modified by the installation of a regenerative heat
exchanger to transfer energy from the air leaving the turbine to the air leaving the
compressor. In an optimum countercurrent exchanger, the temperature of the air leaving the compressor is raised to that of point D in Fig. 8.12, and the temperature of the
gas leaving the turbine is cooled to that of point B in Fig. 8.12. Show that the thermal

8.16. Consider an air-standard cycle for the turbojet power plant shown in Fig. 8.13. The
temperature and pressure of the air entering the compressor are 1 bar and 30°C. The
pressure ratio in the compressor is 6.5, and the temperature at the turbine inlet is
1100°C. If expansion in the nozzle is isentropic and if the nozzle exhausts at 1 bar,
what is the pressure at the nozzle inlet (turbine exhaust), and what is the velocity of
the air leaving the nozzle?
8.17. Air enters a gas-turbine engine (see Fig. 8.11) at 305 K and 1.05 bar and is compressed to 7.5 bar. The fuel is methane at 300 K and 7.5 bar; compressor and turbine
efficiencies are each 80%. For one of the turbine inlet temperatures TC given below,
determine: the molar fuel-to-air ratio, the net mechanical power delivered per mole
of fuel, and the turbine exhaust temperature TD. Assume complete combustion of the
methane and expansion in the turbine to 1(atm).
(a) TC = 1000 K		

(b) TC = 1250 K		

(c) TC = 1500 K

8.18. Most electrical energy in the United States is generated in large-scale power cycles
through conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy, which is then converted
to electrical energy. Assume a thermal efficiency of 0.35 for conversion of thermal to
mechanical energy, and an efficiency of 0.95 for conversion of mechanical to electrical energy. Line losses in the distribution system amount to 20%. If the cost of fuel

for the power cycle is $4.00 GJ−1, estimate the cost of electricity delivered to the customer in $ per kWh. Ignore operating costs, profits, and taxes. Compare this number
with that found on a typical electric bill.
8.19. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is transported in very large tankers, stored as liquid in
equilibrium with its vapor at approximately atmospheric pressure. If LNG is essentially pure methane, the storage temperature then is about 111.4 K, the normal boiling
point of methane. The enormous amount of cold liquid can in principle serve as a heat
sink for an onboard heat engine. Energy discarded to the LNG serves for its vaporization. If the heat source is ambient air at 300 K, and if the efficiency of a heat engine
is 60% of its Carnot value, estimate the vaporization rate in moles vaporized per kJ of
power output. For methane, ​ΔH

8.20. The oceans in the tropics have substantial surface-to-deep-water temperature gradients. Depending on location, relatively constant temperature differences of 15 to 25°C
are observed for depths of 500 to 1000 m. This provides the opportunity for using
cold (deep) water as a heat sink and warm (surface) water as a heat source for a power
cycle. The technology is known as OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion).
(a) Consider a location where the surface temperature is 27°C and the temperature
at a depth of 750 m is 6°C. What is the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating
between these temperature levels?
(b) Part of the output of a power cycle must be used to pump the cold water to the surface, where the cycle hardware resides. If the inherent efficiency of a real cycle is
0.6 of the Carnot value, and if 1/3 of the generated power is used for moving cold
water to the surface, what is the actual efficiency of the cycle?
(c) The choice of working fluid for the cycle is critical. Suggest some possibilities.
Here you may want to consult a handbook, such as Perry’s Chemical Engineers’
Handbook.
8.21. Air-standard power cycles are conventionally displayed on PV diagrams. An alternative is the PT diagram. Sketch air-standard cycles on PT diagrams for the following:
(a) Carnot cycle
(b) Otto cycle
(c) Diesel cycle
(d) Brayton cycle
Why would a PT diagram not be helpful for depicting power cycles involving liquid/
vapor phase changes?
8.22. A steam plant operates on the cycle of Fig. 8.4. The pressure levels are 10 kPa
and 6000 kPa, and steam leaves the turbine as saturated vapor. The pump efficiency
is 0.70, and the turbine efficiency is 0.75. Determine the thermal efficiency of
the plant.

states of each step, Q and W for each step, and the thermal efficiency of the cycle. The
analysis should also include a sketch of the cycle on a PT diagram.

Refrigeration and Liquefaction

The word refrigeration implies the maintenance of a temperature below that of the surroundings. It is best known for its use in the air conditioning of buildings and in the preservation
of foods and chilling of beverages. Examples of large-scale commercial processes requiring
refrigeration are the manufacture of ice and solid CO2, the dehydration and liquefaction of
gases, and the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen.
It is not our purpose here to deal with details of equipment design, which are left to specialized books.1 Rather, we consider:
∙ The model refrigerator, operating on a reverse Carnot cycle
∙ Refrigeration via the vapor-compression cycle, as in the common household refrigerator
and air conditioner
∙ The choice of refrigerants as influenced by their properties
∙ Refrigeration based on vapor absorption, an alternative to vapor compression
∙ Heating or cooling by heat pumps with heat extracted from or rejected to the surroundings
∙ The liquefaction of gases by refrigeration

9.1

THE CARNOT REFRIGERATOR

As indicated in Sec. 5.2, a refrigerator is a heat pump that absorbs heat from a region at a
temperature below that of the surroundings and rejects heat to the surroundings. It operates
with the highest possible efficiency on a Carnot refrigeration cycle, the reverse of the Carnot
engine cycle, as shown by Fig. 5.1(b). The two isothermal steps provide heat absorption QC
at the lower temperature TC and heat rejection QH at the higher temperature TH. The cycle
is completed by two adiabatic steps between these two temperatures. The cycle requires the

addition of net work W to the system. Because all steps of the cycle are reversible, it gives the
minimum possible work required for a given refrigeration effect.
The working fluid operates in a cycle for which ΔU is zero. The first law for the cycle
is therefore:
W = − (QC + QH)

(9.1)

where we note that QC is a positive number and QH (larger in absolute value) is negative. The
measure of the effectiveness of a refrigerator is its coefficient of performance ω, defined as:

Equation (9.3) applies only to a refrigerator operating on a Carnot cycle,
which yields the maximum possible value of ω for a refrigerator operating between given values of TH and TC.
It shows clearly that the refrigeration effect per unit of work decreases as the temperature of heat absorption TC decreases and as the temperature of heat rejection TH increases.

9.2

THE VAPOR-COMPRESSION CYCLE

The vapor-compression refrigeration cycle is represented in Fig. 9.1, along with a TS diagram showing the four steps of the process. A liquid refrigerant evaporating at constant T
and P absorbs heat (line 1 → 2), producing the refrigeration effect. The vapor produced is
compressed via dashed line 2 → 3′ for isentropic compression (Fig. 7.6), and via line 2 → 3,
sloping in the direction of increasing entropy, for an actual compression process, reflecting
inherent irreversibilities. At this higher T and P, it is cooled and condensed (line 3 → 4) with
rejection of heat to the surroundings. Liquid from the condenser expands (line 4 → 1) to its
original pressure. In principle, this can be carried out in a turbine from which work is obtained.
However, for practical reasons it is usually accomplished by throttling through a partly open
control valve. The pressure drop in this irreversible process results from fluid friction in the
valve. As shown in Sec. 7.1, the throttling process occurs at constant enthalpy.

On the basis of a unit mass of fluid, the equations for the heat absorbed in the evaporator
and the heat rejected in the condenser are:
QC = H2 − H1

and

QH = H4 − H3

These equations follow from Eq. (2.31) when the small changes in potential and kinetic energy
are neglected. The work of compression is simply: W

(9.5)

The vapor-compression cycle of Fig. 9.1 is shown on a PH diagram in Fig. 9.2, a diagram
commonly used in the description of refrigeration processes, because it shows the required
enthalpies directly. Although the evaporation and condensation processes are represented by
constant-pressure paths, small pressure drops do occur because of fluid friction.
For given TC and TH, vapor-compression refrigeration results in lower values of ω than
the Carnot cycle because of irreversibilities in expansion and compression. The following
example provides an indication of typical values for coefficients of performance.

2In the United States refrigeration equipment is commonly rated in tons of refrigeration; a ton of refrigeration is
defined as heat absorption at the rate of 12,000(Btu)(hr)−1 or 12,660 kJ per hour. This corresponds approximately to
the rate of heat removal required to freeze 1(ton) of water, initially at 32(°F), per day.

Example 9.1
A refrigerated space is maintained at −20°C, and cooling water is available at 21°C.
Refrigeration capacity is 120,000 kJ⋅h−1. The evaporator and condenser are of sufficient size that a 5°C minimum-temperature difference for heat transfer can be realized
in each. The refrigerant is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), for which data are
given in Table 9.1 and Fig. F.2 (App. F).
(a) What is the value of ω for a Carnot refrigerator?
∙

(b) Calculate ω and m
​​ ​​ for a vapor-compression cycle (Fig. 9.2) if the compressor
efficiency is 0.80.

Solution 9.1
(a) Allowing 5°C temperature differences, the evaporator temperature is −25°C =
248.15 K, and the condenser temperature is 26°C = 299.15 K. Thus, by Eq. (9.3) for
a Carnot refrigerator,

299.15 − 248.15
(b) With HFC-134a as the refrigerant, enthalpies for states 2 and 4 of Fig. 9.2 are read
directly from Table 9.1. The entry at −25°C indicates that HFC-134a vaporizes in
the evaporator at a pressure of 1.064 bar. Its properties as a saturated vapor at these
conditions are:
	​
​H​2​= 383.45 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​

​S​2​= 1.746​kJ​⋅kg​​−1​​⋅K​​−1​​	

331

9.3. The Choice of Refrigerant
The entry at 26°C in Table 9.1 shows that HFC-134a condenses at 6.854 bar; its
enthalpy as a saturated liquid at these conditions is:
	​
​H​4​= 235.97 kJ ​⋅kg​​−1​​	
If the compression step is reversible and adiabatic (isentropic) from saturated
vapor at state 2 to superheated vapor at state 3′,
	​​S​ 3′ ​ ​  = ​S​2​= 1.746 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​​⋅K​​−1​​	
This entropy value and the condenser pressure of 6.854 bar are sufficient to specify the thermodynamic state at point 3′. One could find the other properties at
this state using Fig. F.2, following a curve of constant entropy from the saturation
curve to the condenser pressure. However, more precise results can be obtained
using an electronic resource such as the NIST WebBook. Varying the temperature
at a fixed pressure of 6.854 bar shows that the entropy is 1.746 kJ⋅kg−1⋅K−1 at
T = 308.1 K. The corresponding enthalpy is:
	​​H​ 3′ ​​  = 421.97 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​​	
and the enthalpy change is:
	​
​(​ΔH​)​S​= ​H3​ ′ ​​  − ​H​2​= 421.97 − 383.45 = 38.52 kJ​⋅kg​​−1​​

step 2 → 3 is:

THE CHOICE OF REFRIGERANT

As shown in Sec. 5.2, the efficiency of a Carnot heat engine is independent of the ­working
medium of the engine. Similarly, the coefficient of performance of a Carnot refrigerator is
independent of the refrigerant. The irreversibilities inherent in vapor-compression cycles
cause the coefficient of performance of practical refrigerators to depend to a limited extent
on the refrigerant. Nevertheless, such characteristics as toxicity, flammability, cost, corrosion

332

CHAPTER 9. Refrigeration and Liquefaction

properties, and vapor pressure are of greater importance in the choice of refrigerant. Moreover,
environmental concerns strongly constrain the range of compounds that can be considered for
use as refrigerants. So that air cannot leak into the refrigeration system, the vapor pressure
of the refrigerant at the evaporator temperature should be greater than atmospheric pressure.
On the other hand, the vapor pressure at the condenser temperature should not be unduly high
because of the initial cost and operating expense of high-pressure equipment. These many
requirements limit the choice of refrigerants to relatively few fluids.
Ammonia, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide, propane, and other hydrocarbons can serve
as refrigerants, particularly in industrial applications. Halogenated hydrocarbons came into
common use as refrigerants in the 1930s. Fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons were the
most common refrigerants for several decades. However, these stable molecules were found
to persist in the atmosphere for many years, allowing them to reach the stratosphere before
finally decomposing by reactions that severely deplete stratospheric ozone. As a result, their
production and use is now banned. Certain less-than-fully halogenated hydrocarbons, which
cause relatively little ozone depletion, and hydrofluorocarbons that cause no ozone depletion
now serve as replacements in many applications. A primary example is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
(HFC-134a).3 Unfortunately, these refrigerants have extremely high global warming potentials,
hundreds to thousands of times greater than CO2, and for that reason are now being banned
in many countries. New hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants with lower global warming potential,
such as 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf), are beginning to replace first-generation
hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants such as R134a.
A pressure/enthalpy diagram for 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) is shown in
Fig. F.2 of App. F; Table 9.1 provides saturation data for the same refrigerant. Tables and
­diagrams for a variety of other refrigerants are readily available.4

Cascade Cycles
Limits placed on the operating pressures of the evaporator and condenser of a refrigeration
system also limit the temperature difference TH − TC over which a simple vapor-compression
cycle can operate. With TH fixed by the temperature of the surroundings, a lower limit is
placed on the temperature level of refrigeration. This can be overcome by the operation of
two or more refrigeration cycles employing different refrigerants in a cascade. A two-stage
cascade is shown in Fig. 9.3.
Here, the two cycles operate so that the heat absorbed in the interchanger by the refrigerant
of the higher-temperature cycle 2 serves to condense the refrigerant in the lower-temperature
cycle 1. The two refrigerants are chosen such that each cycle operates at a reasonable pressure.
For example, assume the following operating temperatures (Fig. 9.3):
TH = 30° C  ​​
T​ C′ ​​ ​  = − 16° C  ​​
T​ H
′ ​​ ​  = − 10° C

TC = − 50° C

If tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) is the refrigerant in cycle 2, then the intake and
discharge pressures for the compressor are about 1.6 bar and 7.7 bar, and the pressure ratio is

and 5.8 bar, and the pressure ratio is about 5.3. These are all reasonable values. On the other
hand, for a single cycle operating between −50°C and 30°C with HFC-134a as refrigerant, the
intake pressure to the condenser is about 0.29 bar, well below atmospheric pressure. Moreover,
for a discharge pressure of about 7.7 bar the pressure ratio is 26, too high to achieve with a
single-stage compressor.

9.4

ABSORPTION REFRIGERATION

In vapor-compression refrigeration the work of compression is usually supplied by an electric
motor. But the source of the electric energy is most likely a heat engine (central power plant) used
to drive a generator. Thus the work for refrigeration comes ultimately from a heat engine. This
suggests a combination of cycles wherein work produced by an engine cycle is used internally by a
coupled refrigeration cycle in a device that takes in heat both at elevated temperature TH and at cold
temperature TC and rejects heat to the surroundings at TS. Before considering practical absorptionrefrigeration processes, we first treat a combination of Carnot cycles that produce this effect.
The work required by a Carnot refrigerator absorbing heat at temperature TC and rejecting heat at the temperature of the surroundings TS follows from Eqs. (9.2) and (9.3):

where TS replaces TH and QC is the heat absorbed. If a source of heat is available at a temperature TH > TS, then this work may be obtained from a Carnot engine operating between TH
and TS. The heat required QH for the production of work is found from Eq. (5.5), where we
have substituted TS for TC and changed the sign of W, because W in Eq. (5.5) refers to a Carnot
engine, but here it refers to the refrigerator:

(9.6)

The value of QH/QC given by this equation is of course a minimum because Carnot cycles
cannot be achieved in practice. It provides a limiting value for absorption refrigeration.
A schematic diagram for a typical absorption refrigerator is shown in Fig. 9.4. Note that
just as in the preceding derivation, W
​ ​is eliminated, and both QH and QC enter the system, with
heat discarded only to the surroundings. The essential difference between a vapor-compression
and an absorption refrigerator is in the different means employed for compression. The section
of the absorption unit to the right of the dashed line in Fig. 9.4 is the same as in a vaporcompression refrigerator, but the section to the left accomplishes compression by what amounts
to a heat engine. Refrigerant as vapor from the evaporator is absorbed in a relatively nonvolatile
liquid solvent at the pressure of the evaporator and at relatively low temperature. The heat given
off in the process is discarded to the surroundings at TS. The liquid solution from the absorber,

which contains a relatively high concentration of refrigerant, passes to a pump, which raises
the pressure of the liquid to that of the condenser. Heat from the higher temperature source at
TH is transferred to the compressed liquid solution, raising its temperature and evaporating the
refrigerant from the solvent. Vapor passes from the regenerator to the condenser, and solvent,
which now contains a relatively low concentration of refrigerant, returns to the absorber by way
of a heat exchanger, which serves to conserve energy and adjust stream temperatures toward
optimum values. Low-pressure steam is the usual source of heat for the regenerator.
The most commonly used absorption-refrigeration system operates with water as the
refrigerant and a lithium bromide solution as the absorbent. This system is obviously limited
to refrigeration temperatures above the freezing point of water. It is treated in detail by Perry
and Green.5 For lower temperatures, ammonia can serve as refrigerant with water as the solvent. An alternative system uses methanol as refrigerant and polyglycolethers as absorbent.
Consider refrigeration at a temperature level of −10°C (TC = 263.15 K) with a heat source
of condensing steam at atmospheric pressure (TH = 373.15 K). For a surroundings temperature
of 30°C (TS = 303.15 K), the minimum possible value of QH/QC is found from Eq. (9.6):

For an actual absorption refrigerator, the value would be on the order of three times this result.

9.5 THE HEAT PUMP
The heat pump, a reversed heat engine, is a device for heating houses and commercial buildings during the winter and cooling them during the summer. In the winter it operates so as to
absorb heat from the surroundings and reject heat into the building. Refrigerant evaporates in
coils placed underground or in the outside air; vapor compression is followed by condensation,
heat being transferred to air or water, which is used to heat the building. Compression must
be to a pressure such that the condensation temperature of the refrigerant is higher than the
required temperature level of the building. The operating cost of the installation is the cost of
electric power to run the compressor. If the unit has a coefficient of performance ​Q​C​/ W = 4,​
the heat available to heat the house QH is equal to five times the energy input to the compressor. Any economic advantage of the heat pump as a heating device depends on the cost of
electricity in comparison with the cost of fuels such as oil and natural gas.
The heat pump also serves for air conditioning during the summer. The flow of refrigerant is simply reversed, and heat is absorbed from the building and rejected through underground coils or to the outside air.

Example 9.2
A house has a winter heating requirement of 30 kJ⋅s−1 and a summer cooling
requirement of 60 kJ⋅s−1. Consider a heat-pump installation to maintain the house

temperature at 20°C in winter and 25°C in summer. This requires circulation of the
refrigerant through interior exchanger coils at 30°C in winter and 5°C in summer.
Underground coils provide the heat source in winter and the heat sink in summer. For
a year-round ground temperature of 15°C, the heat-transfer characteristics of the coils
necessitate refrigerant temperatures of 10°C in winter and 25°C in summer. What are
the minimum power requirements for winter heating and summer cooling?

Solution 9.2
The minimum power requirements are provided by a Carnot heat pump. For winter heating, the house coils are at the higher-temperature level TH, and the heat
requirement is QH = 30 kJ⋅s−1. Application of Eq. (5.4) gives:
​T​C​
10 + 273.15
	​
​Q​C​= − ​QH
​ ​___
​ ​= 30​​ _
​
​ ​= 28.02 kJ​⋅s​​−1​​	
(
​T​H​
30 + 273.15 )
This is the heat absorbed in the ground coils. By Eq. (9.1),
	​
W = − ​QH
​ ​− ​Q​C​= 30 − 28.02 = 1.98 kJ​⋅s​​−1​​	
Thus the power requirement is 1.98 kW.
For summer cooling, QC = 60 kJ⋅s−1, and the house coils are at the lowertemperature level TC. Combining Eqs. (9.2) and (9.3) and solving for W:
​T​H​− ​T​C​
25 − 5
	​
W = ​Q​C​______
​
​= 60​​ _
​
​ ​= 4.31 kJ​⋅s​​−1​​	
( 5 + 273.15 )
​T​C​
The power requirement here is therefore 4.31 kW. Actual power requirements for
practical heat pumps are likely to be more than twice this lower limit.

9.6

LIQUEFACTION PROCESSES

Liquefied gases are used for a variety of purposes. For example, liquid propane in cylinders
serves as a domestic fuel, liquid oxygen is carried in rockets, natural gas is liquefied for ocean
transport, and liquid nitrogen provides low-temperature refrigeration. Gas mixtures (e.g., air)
are liquefied for separation into their component species by distillation.
Liquefaction results when a gas is cooled to a temperature in the two-phase region. This
may be accomplished in several ways:
1. By heat exchange at constant pressure.
2. By an expansion process from which work is obtained.
3. By a throttling process.
The first method requires a heat sink at a temperature lower than that to which the gas is
cooled, and is most commonly used to precool a gas prior to its liquefaction by the other two
methods. An external refrigerator is required for a gas temperature below that of the surroundings.

CHAPTER 9. Refrigeration and Liquefaction

The three methods are illustrated in Fig. 9.5. The constant-pressure process (1)
approaches the two-phase region (and liquefaction) most closely for a given drop in temperature. The throttling process (3) does not result in liquefaction unless the initial state is at a low
enough temperature and high enough pressure for the constant-enthalpy process to cut into
the two-phase region. This is indeed the situation for an initial state at A′, but not at A, where
the temperature is the same but the pressure is lower than at A. The change of state from A to
A′ may be accomplished by compression of the gas to the pressure at B and constant-pressure
cooling to A′. Reference to a PH diagram for air6 shows that at a temperature of 160 K, the
pressure must be greater than about 80 bar for any liquefaction to occur along a path of constant enthalpy. Thus, if air is compressed to at least 80 bar and cooled below 160 K, it can be
partially liquefied by throttling. An efficient process for cooling the gas is by countercurrent
heat exchange with that portion of the gas which does not liquefy in the throttling process.

Liquefaction by isentropic expansion along process (2) occurs from lower pressures (for
given temperature) than by throttling. For example, continuation of process (2) from initial
state A ultimately results in liquefaction.
The throttling process (3) is commonly employed in small-scale commercial
liquefaction plants. The temperature of the gas must decrease during expansion, and
this indeed occurs with most gases at usual conditions of temperature and pressure. The
exceptions are hydrogen and helium, which increase in temperature upon throttling unless
the initial temperature is below about 100 K for hydrogen and 20 K for helium. Liquefaction
of these gases by throttling requires initial cooling to temperatures lower than obtained by
method 1 or 2.
The Linde liquefaction process, which depends solely on throttling expansion, is shown
in Fig. 9.6. After compression, the gas is precooled to ambient temperature. It may be even
further cooled by refrigeration. The lower the temperature of the gas entering the throttle
valve, the greater the fraction of gas that is liquefied. For example, a refrigerant evaporating
in the cooler at −40°C provides a lower temperature at the valve than if water at 20°C is the
cooling medium.

A more efficient liquefaction process would replace the throttle valve with an expander,
but operating such a device into the two-phase region is impractical. The Claude process,
shown in Fig. 9.7, is based in part on this idea. Gas at an intermediate temperature is extracted
from the heat-exchange system and passed through an expander from which it exhausts as
a saturated or slightly superheated vapor. The remaining gas is further cooled and throttled
through a valve to produce liquefaction as in the Linde process. The unliquefied portion,
which is saturated vapor, mixes with the expander exhaust and returns for recycle through the
heat-exchanger system.
An energy balance, Eq. (2.30), applied to that part of the process lying to the right of the
dashed vertical line yields:

passed through the expander. This latter quantity (x) is a design variable and must be specified
before Eq. (9.7) can be solved for z. Note that the Linde process results when x = 0, and in this
event Eq. (9.7) reduces to:

(9.8)

Thus the Linde process is a limiting case of the Claude process, obtained when none of
the high-pressure gas stream is sent to an expander.
Equations (9.7) and (9.8) suppose that no heat flows into the system from the surroundings. This can never be exactly true, and heat leakage may be significant when temperatures
are very low, even with well-insulated equipment.

Example 9.3
Natural gas, assumed here to be pure methane, is liquefied in a Claude process. Compression is to 60 bar and precooling is to 300 K. The expander and throttle exhaust
to a pressure of 1 bar. Recycle methane at this pressure leaves the exchanger system (point 15, Fig. 9.7) at 295 K. Assume no heat leaks into the system from the

341

surroundings, an expander efficiency of 75%, and an expander exhaust of saturated
vapor. For a draw-off to the expander of 25% of the methane entering the exchanger
system (x = 0.25), what fraction z of the methane is liquefied, and what is the temperature of the high-pressure stream entering the throttle valve?

Solution 9.3
Data for methane are available in the NIST WebBook,7 from which the following
values were obtained:

​H​12​= 510.6 ​kJ·kg​​−1​
​S​12​ = 4.579 ​kJ·kg​​−1​​·K​​−1​ ​(​saturated vapor​)​
The enthalpy at the draw-off point between exchangers I and II, H5, is required
for solution of Eq. (9.7). The expander efficiency η is known, as is H12, the
enthalpy of the expander exhaust. The calculation of H5 (=H11), the expander
inlet enthalpy, is less straightforward than the usual calculation of the exhaust
enthalpy from the entrance enthalpy. The equation defining expander efficiency
can be written:
	​
ΔH = ​H​12​− ​H​5​= η ​(​ΔH​)​S​= η(​H12
′​  ​​  − ​H​ 5​​)​	
Solution for H12 yields:
	​
​H​12​= ​H​5​+ η(​H12
​ ′ ​​  − ​H​ 5​​)​	

(A)

where ​​H12
′​   ​​​  is the enthalpy at 1 bar as the result of isentropic expansion from point
5. This enthalpy is readily found once the conditions at point 5 are known. Thus
a trial calculation is indicated, wherein the first step is to assume temperature T5.
This leads to values for H5 and S5, from which H​ 
​​ 12
′ ​​​  can be found. All quantities
in Eq. (A) are then known, and their substitution into this equation shows whether
or not it is satisfied. If not, a new value is chosen for T5, and the process continues until Eq. (A) is satisfied. For example, at 60 bar and 260 K, the enthalpy and
entropy are 745.27 kJ⋅kg−1 and 4.033 kJ⋅kg−1⋅K−1, respectively. The saturated liquid and vapor at 1 bar have Sl = −0.005 and Sv = 4.579, respectively. Using these
values, isentropic expansion from 260 K and 60 bar to 1 bar would give a vapor
fraction of 0.8808. This would give:
	​​H​ 12

CHAPTER 9. Refrigeration and Liquefaction
Using this value in Eq. (A) yields H12 = 508.8 kJ⋅kg−1, which is below the known
value of H12 = 510.6 kJ⋅kg−1. Thus, T5 must be higher than the assumed value of
260 K. Repeating this process (in an automated fashion using a spreadsheet) for
other values of T5 shows that Eq. (A) is satisfied for:

	​
​T​5​= 261.2 K ​H​5​= 748.8​kJ⋅kg​​−1​ ​(​at 60 bar​)​​

	​
z = ​___________________________
   ​= 0.1187​	
− 0.6 − 903.0
Thus 11.9% of the methane entering the exchanger system is liquefied.
The temperature at point 7 depends on its enthalpy, which is found from energy
balances on the exchanger system. Thus, for exchanger I,

As the value of x increases, T7 decreases, eventually approaching the saturation
temperature in the separator, and requiring an exchanger II of infinite area. Thus x
is limited on the high side by the cost of the exchanger system.
The other limit is for x = 0, the Linde system, for which by Eq. (9.8),
855.3 − 903.0

− 0.6 − 903.0

In this case only 5.3% of the gas entering the throttle valve emerges as liquid. The
temperature of the gas at point 7 is again found from its enthalpy, calculated by
the energy balance:
	​
​H​7​= ​H​4​− ​(​1 − z​)​(​H​15​− ​H​10​)​​	
Substitution of known values yields:
	​
​H​7​= 855.3 − ​(​1 − 0.0528​)​(​903.0 − 510.6​)​= 483.6 ​kJ⋅kg​​−1​​	
The corresponding temperature of the methane entering the throttle valve is
T7 = 202.1 K.

PROBLEMS

9.1. An easy way to rationalize definitions of cycle performance is to think of them as:
What you get
	​
Measure of performance = ______________
​  
  ​​
What you pay for
Thus, for an engine, thermal efficiency is ​η = ​|​W​|​/ ​|​QH
​ ​|​; for a refrigerator, the coefficient of performance is ​ω = ​|​Q​C​|​/ ​|​W​|​. Define a coefficient of performance ϕ for a heat
pump. What is ϕ for a Carnot heat pump?
9.2. The contents of the freezer in a home refrigerator are maintained at −20°C. The
kitchen temperature is 20°C. If heat leaks amount to 125,000 kJ per day, and if electricity costs $0.08/kWh, estimate the yearly cost of running the refrigerator. Assume a
coefficient of performance equal to 60% of the Carnot value.

344

CHAPTER 9. Refrigeration and Liquefaction

9.3. Consider the startup of a refrigerator. Initially, the contents are at the same
­temperature as the surroundings: ​T​​C​0​​ = ​T​H​,​ where TH is the (constant) surroundings
­temperature. With the passage of time, owing to work input, the contents’ ­temperature
is reduced from ​​T​​C​0​​​ to its design value TC. Modeling the process as a Carnot
­refrigerator ­operating between an infinite hot reservoir and a finite cold reservoir of
total heat capacity Ct, determine an expression for the minimum work required to
decrease the contents ­temperature from ​T​​C​0​​​ to TC.
9.4. A Carnot refrigerator has tetrafluoroethane as the working fluid. The cycle is the same
as that shown by Fig. 8.2, except the directions are reversed. For TC = −12°C and
TH = 40°C, determine:
(a) The pressures at states 1, 2, 3, and 4.
(b) The quality xv at states 3 and 4.
(c) The heat addition per kg of fluid.
(d) The heat rejection per kg of fluid.
(e) The mechanical power per kg of fluid for each of the four steps.
(f) The coefficient of performance ω for the cycle.
9.5. Which is the more effective way to increase the coefficient of performance of a Carnot
refrigerator: to increase TC with TH constant, or to decrease TH with TC constant? For
a real refrigerator, does either of these strategies make sense?
9.6. In comparing the performance of a real cycle with that of a Carnot cycle, one has
in principle a choice of temperatures to use for the Carnot calculation. Consider a
vapor-compression refrigeration cycle in which the average fluid temperatures in
the condenser and evaporator are TH and TC, respectively. Corresponding to TH and
TC, the heat transfer occurs with respect to surroundings at temperature ​T​σ​ ​H​​ and ​T​σ​ ​C​​.​
Which provides the more conservative estimate of ωCarnot: a calculation based on TH
and TC, or one based on ​T​σ​ ​H​​ and ​T​σ​ ​C​​?​
9.7. A Carnot engine is coupled to a Carnot refrigerator so that all of the work produced by
the engine is used by the refrigerator in extraction of heat from a heat reservoir at 0°C
at the rate of 35 kJ⋅s−1. The source of energy for the Carnot engine is a heat reservoir
at 250°C. If both devices discard heat to the surroundings at 25°C, how much heat
does the engine absorb from its heat-source reservoir?
If the actual coefficient of performance of the refrigerator is ω = 0.6 ωCarnot and if
the thermal efficiency of the engine is η = 0.6ηCarnot, how much heat does the engine
absorb from its heat-source reservoir?
9.8. A refrigeration system requires 1.5 kW of power for a refrigeration rate of 4 kJ⋅s−1.
(a) What is the coefficient of performance?
(b) How much heat is rejected in the condenser?
(c) If heat rejection is at 40°C, what is the lowest temperature the system can possibly
maintain?

9.9. A vapor-compression refrigeration system operates on the cycle of Fig. 9.1. The
refrigerant is tetrafluoroethane (Table 9.1, Fig. F.2). For one of the following sets of
operating conditions, determine the circulation rate of the refrigerant, the heat-transfer
rate in the condenser, the power requirement, the coefficient of performance of the
cycle, and the coefficient of performance of a Carnot refrigeration cycle operating
between the same temperature levels.
(a) Evaporation T = 0°C; condensation T = 26°C; η(compressor) = 0.79; refrigeration
rate = 600 kJ·s−1.
(b) Evaporation T = 6°C; condensation T = 26°C; η(compressor) = 0.78; refrigeration
rate = 500 kJ·s−1.
(c) Evaporation T = −12°C; condensation T = 26°C; η(compressor) = 0.77; refrigeration rate = 400 kJ·s−1.
(d) Evaporation T = −18°C; condensation T = 26°C; η(compressor) = 0.76; refrigeration rate = 300 kJ·s−1.
(e) Evaporation T = −25°C; condensation T = 26°C; η(compressor) = 0.75; refrigeration rate = 200 kJ·s−1.
9.10. A vapor-compression refrigeration system operates on the cycle of Fig. 9.1. The
refrigerant is water. Given that the evaporation T = 4°C, the condensation T = 34°C,
η(compressor) = 0.76, and the refrigeration rate = 1200 kJ⋅s−1, determine the circulation rate of the refrigerant, the heat-transfer rate in the condenser, the power requirement, the coefficient of performance of the cycle, and the coefficient of performance
of a Carnot refrigeration cycle operating between the same temperature levels.
9.11. A refrigerator with tetrafluoroethane (Table 9.1, Fig. F.2) as refrigerant operates with
an evaporation temperature of −25°C and a condensation temperature of 26°C. Saturated liquid refrigerant from the condenser flows through an expansion valve into the
evaporator, from which it emerges as saturated vapor.
(a) For a cooling rate of 5 kJ·s−1, what is the circulation rate of the refrigerant?
(b) By how much would the circulation rate be reduced if the throttle valve were
replaced by a turbine in which the refrigerant expands isentropically?
(c) Suppose the cycle of (a) is modified by the inclusion of a countercurrent heat
exchanger between the condenser and the throttle valve in which heat is transferred to vapor returning from the evaporator. If liquid from the condenser enters
the exchanger at 26°C and if vapor from the evaporator enters the exchanger at
−25°C and leaves at 20°C, what is the circulation rate of the refrigerant?
(d) For each of (a), (b), and (c), determine the coefficient of performance for isentropic compression of the vapor.
9.12. A vapor-compression refrigeration system is conventional except that a countercurrent heat exchanger is installed to subcool the liquid from the condenser by heat
exchange with the vapor stream from the evaporator. The minimum temperature difference for heat transfer is 5°C. Tetrafluoroethane is the refrigerant (Table 9.1, Fig.
F.2), evaporating at −6°C and condensing at 26°C. The heat load on the evaporator is

346

CHAPTER 9. Refrigeration and Liquefaction
2000 kJ·s−1. If the compressor efficiency is 75%, what is the power requirement? How
does this result compare with the power required by the compressor if the system
operates without the heat exchanger? How do the refrigerant circulation rates compare
for the two cases?

9.13. Consider the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle of Fig. 9.1 with tetrafluoroethane
as refrigerant (Table 9.1, Fig. F.2). If the evaporation temperature is −12°C, show the
effect of condensation temperature on the coefficient of performance by making calculations for condensation temperatures of 16, 28, and 40°C.
(a) Assume isentropic compression of the vapor.
(b) Assume a compressor efficiency of 75%.
9.14. A heat pump is used to heat a house in the winter and to cool it in the summer. During
the winter, the outside air serves as a low-temperature heat source; during the summer,
it acts as a high-temperature heat sink. The heat-transfer rate through the walls and
roof of the house is 0.75 kJ⋅s−1 for each °C of temperature difference between the
inside and outside of the house, summer and winter. The heat-pump motor is rated
at 1.5 kW. Determine the minimum outside temperature for which the house can be
maintained at 20°C during the winter and the maximum outside temperature for which
the house can be maintained at 25°C during the summer.
9.15. Dry methane is supplied by a compressor and precooling system to the cooler of a
Linde liquid-methane system (Fig. 9.6) at 180 bar and 300 K. The low-pressure methane leaves the cooler at a temperature 6°C lower than the temperature of the incoming
high-pressure methane. The separator operates at 1 bar, and the product is saturated
liquid at this pressure. What is the maximum fraction of the methane entering the
cooler that can be liquefied? The NIST Chemistry WebBook (http://webbook.nist.
gov/chemistry/fluid/) is a source of data for methane.
9.16. Rework the preceding problem for methane entering at 200 bar and precooled to
240 K by external refrigeration.
9.17. An advertisement is noted in a rural newspaper for a dairy-barn unit that combines a
milk cooler with a water heater. Milk must, of course, be refrigerated, and hot water
is required for washing purposes. The usual barn is equipped with a conventional aircooled electric refrigerator and an electric-resistance water heater. The new unit is
said to provide both the necessary refrigeration and the required hot water at a cost
for electricity about the same as the cost of running just the refrigerator in the usual
installation. To assess this claim, compare two refrigeration units: The advertised unit
takes 15 kJ·s−1 from a milk cooler at −2°C, and discards heat through a condenser at
65°C to raise the temperature of water from 13 to 63°C. The conventional unit takes
the same amount of heat from the same milk cooler at −2°C and discards heat through
an air-cooled condenser at 50°C; in addition, the same amount of water is heated electrically from 13 to 63°C. Estimate the total electric power requirements for the two
cases, assuming that the actual work in both is 50% greater than required by Carnot
refrigerators operating between the given temperatures.

9.8. Problems

347

9.18. A two-stage cascade refrigeration system (see Fig. 9.3) operates between TC = 210 K
and TH = 305 K. Intermediate temperatures are ​​T​ C′ ​​  = 255 K​ and ​​TH
′​   ​​  = 260 K​. Coefficients of performance ω of each stage are 65% of the corresponding values for a
Carnot refrigerator. Determine ω for the real cascade, and compare it with that for a
Carnot refrigerator operating between TC and TH.
9.19. Do a parametric study for the Claude liquefaction process treated in Sec. 9.6 and
Ex. 9.3. In particular, show numerically the effect of changing the draw-off ratio x
on other process variables. The NIST Chemistry WebBook (http://webbook.nist.gov/
chemistry/fluid/) is a source of data for methane.
9.20. The condenser of a home refrigerator is commonly underneath the appliance; thus,
the condensing refrigerant exchanges heat with household air, which has an average
temperature of about 21°C. It is proposed to reconfigure a refrigerator so that the
condenser is outside the home, where the average yearly temperature is about 10°C.
Discuss the pros and cons of this proposal. Assume a freezer temperature of −18°C,
and an actual coefficient of performance 60% that of a Carnot refrigerator.
9.21. A common misconception is that the coefficient of performance of a refrigerator must
be less than unity. In fact, this is rarely the case. To see why, consider a real refrigerator for which ω = 0.6 ω Carnot. What condition must be satisfied in order for ω < 1?
Assume that TH is fixed.
9.22. A furnace fails in a home in the winter. Mercifully, the electric power remains on. The
resident engineer tells her spouse not to worry; they’ll move into the kitchen, where
the heat discarded from the refrigerator may provide for a temporarily comfortable
living space. However (the engineer is reminded), the kitchen loses heat to the outdoors. Use the following data to determine the allowable rate of heat loss (kW) from
the kitchen for the engineer’s proposal to make sense.
Data:  Desired kitchen temperature = 290 K.
Refrigerator freezer temperature = 250 K.
Average mechanical power input to refrigerator = 0.40 kW.
Performance: Actual ω = 65% of Carnot ω.
9.23. Fifty (50) kmol·h−1 of liquid toluene at 1.2 bar is cooled from 100 to 20°C. A
vapor-compression refrigeration cycle is used for the purpose. Ammonia is the working fluid. Condensation in the cycle is effected by an air-cooled fin/fan heat exchanger
for which the air temperature may be assumed essentially constant at 20°C. Determine:
(a) The low and high pressure levels (bar) in the refrigeration cycle.
(b) The circulation rate of ammonia (mol·s−1).

The Framework of Solution
Thermodynamics

Our purpose in this chapter is to lay the theoretical foundation for applications of
thermodynamics to gas mixtures and liquid solutions. Throughout the chemical, energy,
microelectronics, personal care, and pharmaceutical industries, multicomponent fluid mixtures
undergo composition changes brought about by mixing and separation processes, the transfer
of species from one phase to another, and chemical reaction. Thus, measures of composition
become essential variables, along with temperature and pressure, which we already considered
in detail in Chap. 6. This adds substantially to the complexity of tabulating and correlating
­thermodynamic properties, and leads to the introduction of a menagerie of new variables and
relationships among them. Applying these relationships to practical problems, such as phase
equilibrium calculations, requires that we first map out this “thermodynamic zoo.” Thus, in
the present chapter, we:
∙ Develop a fundamental property relation that is applicable to open phases of variable
composition.
∙ Define the chemical potential, a fundamental new property that facilitates treatment of
phase and chemical-reaction equilibria.
∙ Introduce partial properties, a class of thermodynamic properties defined mathematically to distribute total mixture properties among individual species as they exist in a
mixture. These are composition-dependent and distinct from the molar properties of
pure species.
∙ Develop property relations for the ideal-gas-state mixture, which provide the basis for
treatment of real-gas mixtures.
∙ Define yet another useful property, the fugacity. Related to the chemical potential, it
lends itself to mathematical formulation of both phase- and chemical-reaction-equilibrium
problems.
∙ Introduce a useful class of solution properties, known as excess properties, in conjunction with an idealization of solution behavior called the ideal-solution model, which
serves as a reference for real-solution behavior.
348

10.1. Fundamental Property Relation

Measures of Composition
The three most common measures of composition in thermodynamics are mass fraction, mole
fraction, and molar concentration. Mass or mole fraction is defined as the ratio of the mass or
number of moles of a particular chemical species in a mixture to the total mass or number of
moles of mixture:
∙

​m​i​ ​​m​​  i​​
	​
​x​i​≡ ___
​ ​= ___
​  ∙  ​   or  
m
​m​

∙

​n​i​ ​​n​​  i​​
​x​i​≡ __
​ ​= __
​  ∙  ​​	
n
​n​

Molar concentration is defined as the ratio of the mole fraction of a particular chemical
species in a mixture or solution to the molar volume of the mixture or solution:
​x​i​
	​
​C​i​≡ __
​ ​​	
V
This quantity has units of moles of i per unit volume. For flow processes, convenience sug∙
gests its expression as a ratio of rates. Multiplying and dividing by molar flow rate ​​n​​ gives:
∙

​​n​​  i​​
	​
​C​i​≡ __
​   ​​	
q
∙

where n​​​ ​​  i​​​is molar flow rate of species i, and q is volumetric flow rate.
The molar mass of a mixture or solution is, by definition, the mole-fraction-weighted
sum of the molar masses of all species present:
	​
ℳ ≡ ​∑​ ​​x​i​​ℳ​i​​	
i

In the present chapter, we develop the framework of solution thermodynamics using
mole fractions as composition variables. For nonreacting systems, virtually all of the same
development can be done using mass fractions, yielding identical definitions and equations.
Thus, we may take xi to represent either a mole fraction or mass fraction in nonreacting
systems. In reacting systems, it is nearly always best to work in terms of mole fractions.

10.1

FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY RELATION

Equation (6.7) relates the total Gibbs energy of any closed system to its canonical variables,
temperature and pressure:
	​
d​(​nG​)​= ​(​nV ​)​dP − ​(​nS​)​dT​	

(6.7)

where n is the total number of moles of the system. It applies to a single-phase fluid in a closed
system wherein no chemical reactions occur. For such a system the composition is necessarily
constant, and therefore:
∂ ​(​nG​)​
∂ ​(​nG​)​
	​​​ _____
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​  ​​ = nV   and   ​ _____
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​  ​​ = − nS​	
[ ∂P ]
[ ∂T ]
T, n
P, n
The subscript n indicates that the numbers of moles of all chemical species are held constant.

350

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

For the more general case of a single-phase, open system, material may pass into and
out of the system, and nG becomes a function of the numbers of moles of the chemical species
present. It remains a function of T and P, and we can therefore write the functional relation:
	​
nG = g​​(​P, T, ​n​1​, ​n​2​, . . ., ​n​i​, . . .​)​​	
where ni is the number of moles of species i. The total differential of nG is then:
∂ ​(​nG​)​
∂ ​(​nG​)​
∂ ​(​nG​)​
	​
d​(​nG​)​= ​ _____
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​  ​​ dP + ​ _____
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​  ​​ dT + ​∑​ ​​ _____
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​ 
​​ d​n​i​​	
[ ∂P ]
[ ∂T ]
[ ∂ ​n​i​ ]
P, T,​n​​
i
T, n
P, n
j

The summation is over all species present, and subscript nj indicates that all mole numbers
except the ith are held constant. The derivative in the final term is given its own symbol and
name. Thus, by definition the chemical potential of species i in the mixture is:
∂ ​(​nG​)​
	​
​μ​i​≡ ​ _____
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​ 
​​​	
[ ∂ ​n​i​ ]
P, T, ​n​​

(10.1)

j

With this definition and with the first two partial derivatives replaced by (nV) and −(nS), the
preceding equation becomes:
	​
​d​(​nG​)​= ​(​nV​)​dP − ​(​nS​)​dT + ​∑​ ​​μ​i​d​n​i​​	

(10.2)

i

Equation (10.2) is the fundamental property relation for single-phase fluid systems
of variable mass and composition. It is the foundation upon which the structure of solution
thermodynamics is built. For the special case of one mole of solution, n = 1 and ni = xi:
	​
dG = VdP − SdT + ​∑​ ​​μ​i​d​x​i​​	

(10.3)

i

Implicit in this equation is the functional relationship of the molar Gibbs energy to its canonical
variables, here: T, P, and {xi}:
	​
G = G​​(​T, P, ​x​1​, ​x​2​, . . ., ​x​i​, . . .​)​​	
Equation (6.11) for a constant-composition solution is a special case of Eq. (10.3).
Although the mole numbers ni of Eq. (10.2) are independent variables, the mole fractions xi in
Eq. (10.3) are not, because ​∑​i​​x​i​ = 1.​This precludes certain mathematical operations which
depend upon independence of the variables. Nevertheless, Eq. (10.3) does imply:
∂G
​V = ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​​
( ∂ P )T, x

(10.4)

∂G
​S = − ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​​
( ∂ T )P, x

(10.5)

Other solution properties come from definitions; e.g., the enthalpy, from H = G + TS. Thus,
by Eq. (10.5),
∂G
	​
H = G − T ​ ___
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​​	
( ∂ T )P, x

351

10.2. The Chemical Potential and Equilibrium
When the Gibbs energy is expressed as a function of its canonical variables, it serves as a generating function, providing the means for the
calculation of all other thermodynamic properties by simple mathematical operations (differentiation and elementary algebra), and it implicitly
represents complete property information.

This is a more general statement of the conclusion drawn in Sec. 6.1, now extended to
systems of variable composition.

10.2

THE CHEMICAL POTENTIAL AND EQUILIBRIUM

Practical applications of the chemical potential will become clearer in later chapters that treat
chemical and phase equilibria. However, at this point one can already appreciate its role in
these analyses. For a closed, single-phase PVT system containing chemically reactive species,
Eqs. (6.7) and (10.2) must both be valid, the former simply because the system is closed and
the second because of its generality. In addition, for a closed system, all differentials dni in
Eq. (10.2) must result from chemical reaction. Comparison of these two equations shows that
they can both be valid only if:
	​
​∑​ ​​μ​i​ d​n​i​= 0​	
i

This equation therefore represents a general criterion for chemical-reaction equilibrium
in a single-phase closed PVT system, and is the basis for the development of working equations for the solution of reaction-equilibrium problems.
With respect to phase equilibrium, we note that for a closed nonreacting system consisting of two phases in equilibrium, each individual phase is open to the other, and mass transfer
between phases may occur. Equation (10.2) applies separately to each phase:
d​​(nG)​​​  α​ = ​(nV)​​  α​dP − ​(nS)​​  α​dT + ​∑​ ​​μ​  iα​  ​ ​dn​  iα​  ​
i

	​​    
​  ​ 
​	​
β
β ​
d​(nG)​​  β​ = ​(nV)​​  β​dP − ​(nS)​​  β​dT + ​∑​ ​​μ​  i​  ​​dn​  i​  ​
i

where superscripts α and β identify the phases. For the system to be in thermal and mechanical
equilibrium, T and P must be uniform.
The change in the total Gibbs energy of the two-phase system is the sum of the equations
for the separate phases. When each total-system property is expressed by an equation of the form,
	​
nM = ​(​nM​)​α​+ ​(​nM​)​β​​	
β

β

the sum is:	​d​​(​nG​)​= ​(​nV​)​dP − ​(​nS​)​dT + ​∑​ ​​μ​  iα​  ​d​n​  iα​  ​+ ​∑​ ​​μ​  i​  ​d​n​  i​  ​​
i

i

Because the two-phase system is closed, Eq. (6.7) is also valid. Comparison of the two equations shows that at equilibrium:
β

β

	​
​∑​ ​μ​  iα​  ​d​n​  iα​  ​+ ​∑​ ​μ​  i​  ​d​n​  i​  ​= 0​	
i

i

352

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics
β

The changes d​ ​n​  iα​  ​​and d​ ​n​  i​  ​​result from mass transfer between the phases; mass c­ onservation
therefore requires:
β

	​
d​n​  iα​  ​= − d​n​  i​  ​   and  

β

​∑​ ​(​μ​  iα​  ​− ​μ​  i​  ​)d​n​  iα​  ​= 0​	
i

Quantities ​d​n​  iα​  ​​are independent and arbitrary, and the only way the left side of the second
equation can in general be zero is for each term in parentheses separately to be zero. Hence,
β

	​​μ​  iα​  ​= ​μ​  i​  ​   ​(​ ​i = 1, 2, . . ., N​)​​	
where N is the number of species present in the system. Successive application of this result to
pairs of phases permits its generalization to multiple phases; for π phases:
β

	​​​μ​  iα​  ​= ​μ​  i​  ​= ⋯ = ​μ​  iπ​  ​​

  ​(​ ​i = 1, 2, . . ., N​)​​	

(10.6)

A similar but more comprehensive derivation shows (as we have supposed) that for equilibrium T and P must be the same in all phases.
Thus, multiple phases at the same T and P are in equilibrium when the
chemical potential of each species is the same in all phases.
The application of Eq. (10.6) in later chapters to specific phase-equilibrium problems
requires models of solution behavior, which provide expressions for G and μi as functions of
temperature, pressure, and composition. The simplest of these, the ideal-gas state mixture and
the ideal solution, are treated in Secs. 10.4 and 10.8, respectively.

10.3

PARTIAL PROPERTIES

The definition of the chemical potential by Eq. (10.1) as the mole-number derivative of nG
suggests that other derivatives of this kind may prove useful in solution thermodynamics.
Thus, we define the partial molar property M
​​​ ¯ ​​  i​​​ of species i in solution as:
∂ ​(​nM​)​
	​​​​M¯​​  i​​ ≡ ​ ______
​​ 
 ​
​ ​​ 
​​​​	
[ ∂ ​n​i​ ] P, T, ​n​​

(10.7)

j

Sometimes called a response function, it is a measure of the response of total property nM to
the addition of an infinitesimal amount of species i to a finite amount of solution, at constant
T and P.
The generic symbols M and M
​​​ ¯​​  i​​​may express solution properties on a unit-mass basis as
well as on a molar basis. Equation (10.7) retains the same form, with n, the number of moles,
replaced by m, representing mass, and yielding partial specific properties rather than partial
molar properties. To accommodate either, one may speak simply of partial properties.
Interest here centers on solutions, for which molar (or unit-mass) properties are represented by the plain symbol M. Partial properties are denoted by an overbar, with a subscript
to identify the species; the symbol is therefore ​​​M¯​​  i​​​. In addition, properties of the individual
species as they exist in the pure state at the T and P of the solution are identified by only a

​ ​​ 
​​​
∂ ​n​i​ ] P, T, ​n​j​

(A)

What physical interpretation can be given to this equation?

Solution 10.1
Suppose an open beaker containing an equimolar mixture of ethanol and water
occupies a total volume nV at room temperature T and atmospheric pressure P.
Add to this solution a drop of pure water, also at T and P, containing Δnw moles,
and mix it thoroughly into the solution, allowing sufficient time for heat exchange
to return the contents of the beaker to the initial temperature. One might expect
that the volume of solution increases by an amount equal to the volume of the
water added, i.e., by VwΔnw, where Vw is the molar volume of pure water at T and
P. If this were true, the total volume change would be:
	​
Δ​(​nV​)​= ​Vw​ ​Δ ​n​w​​
However, experimental observations show that the actual volume change is somewhat
less. ­Evidently, the effective molar volume of water in the final solution is less
than the molar volume of pure water at the same T and P. We may therefore write:
	​
Δ​(​nV​)​= ​​V˜ ​​  w​​ Δ ​n​w​​

(B)

where V
​​​ ˜ ​​  w​​​represents the effective molar volume of water in the final solution. Its
experimental value is given by:
Δ​(​ ​nV​)​
	​​​V˜ ​​  w​​ = ______
​
​
Δ ​n​w​

(C)

In the process described, a drop of water is mixed with a substantial amount of solution, and the result is a small but measurable change in composition of the solution.

354

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics
For the effective molar volume of the water to be considered a property of the original
equimolar solution, the process must be taken to the limit of an infinitesimal drop.
Whence, Δ
​ ​n​w​→ 0,​and Eq. (C) becomes:
Δ​(​ ​nV​)​ _____
d​​(​nV​)​
	​​​V˜ ​​  w​​ = ​ lim​ ​______
​
​= ​
​​
Δ​n​w​→0 Δ ​n​w​
d​n​w​
Because T, P, and na (the number of moles of alcohol) are constant, this equation
is more appropriately written:
∂ ​(​nV​)​
	​​​V˜ ​​  w​​ = ​ ​_____
​ 
 ​​ ​​ 
​​​
[ ∂ ​n​w​ ]
P, T, ​n​ ​
a

Comparison with Eq. (A) shows that in this limit ​​​V˜ ​​  w​​​is the partial molar volume ​​​V¯​​  w​​​
of the water in the equimolar solution, i.e., the rate of change of the total solution
volume with nw at constant T, P, and na for a specific composition. Written for the
addition of dnw moles of water to the solution, Eq. (B) is then:
	​
d​(​nV​)​= ​​V¯​​  w​​ d​n​w​​

(D)

When ​​​V¯​​  w​​​is considered the molar property of water as it exists in solution, the total
volume change d(nV) is merely this molar property multiplied by the number of
moles dnw of water added.
If dnw moles of water is added to a volume of pure water, then we have every
reason to expect the volume change of the system to be:
	​
d​(​nV​)​= ​Vw​ ​d​n​w​​

(E)

where Vw is the molar volume of pure water at T and P. Comparison of Eqs. (D)
and (E) indicates that ​​​V¯​​  w​​ = ​Vw​ ​when the “solution” is pure water.

Equations Relating Molar and Partial Molar Properties
The definition of a partial molar property, Eq. (10.7), provides the means for calculation of
partial properties from solution-property data. Implicit in this definition is another, equally
important, equation that allows the reverse, i.e., calculation of solution properties from knowledge
of the partial properties. The derivation of this equation starts with the observation that
the total thermodynamic properties of a homogeneous phase are functions of T, P, and the
numbers of moles of the individual species that comprise the phase.1 Thus for property M,
we can write nM as a function which we could call 𝕄
​ ​:
	​
nM = 𝕄​​(​T, P, ​n​1​, ​n​2​, . . ., ​n​i​, . . .​)​​	
The total differential of nM is:
∂ (​ ​nM​)​
∂ ​(​nM​)​
∂ ​(​nM​)​
	​
d​(​nM​)​= ​ ​______

10.3. Partial Properties

where subscript n indicates that all mole numbers are held constant, and subscript nj that all
mole numbers except ni are held constant. Because the first two partial derivatives on the
right are evaluated at constant n and because the partial derivative of the last term is given by
Eq. (10.7), this equation has the simpler form:
∂M
∂M
	​
d​(​nM​)​= n​​ ___

i

(10.9)

where subscript x denotes differentiation at constant composition. Because ni = xin,
	​
d​n​i​= ​x​i​ dn + n d​x​i​​	
Moreover,
	​
d​(​nM​)​= n dM + M dn​	
When dni and d(nM) are replaced in Eq. (10.9), it becomes:
∂M
∂M
	​
n dM + M dn = n ​ ​___
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dP + n ​ ​___
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dT + ​∑​ ​​​M¯​​  i​​​(​​x​i​ dn + n d​x​i​)​​	
( ∂ P )T, x
( ∂ T )P, x
i
The terms containing n are collected and separated from those containing dn to yield:
∂M
∂M
	​​​ ​dM − ​ ​___
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dP − ​ ​___
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dT − ​∑​ ​​​M¯​​  i​​ d​x​i​ ​n + ​ ​M − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​​M¯​​  i​​​ ​dn = 0​

i
In application, one is free to choose a system of any size, as represented by n, and to
choose any variation in its size, as represented by dn. Thus n and dn are independent and
­arbitrary. The only way that the left side of this equation can then, in general, be zero is for
each term in brackets to be zero. Therefore,
∂M

dM = ​ ​___

i

Multiplication of Eq. (10.11) by n yields the alternative expression:
	​​nM = ​∑​ ​​n​i​​​M¯​​  i​​​​	

(10.12)

i

Equation (10.10) is in fact just a special case of Eq. (10.9), obtained by setting n = 1,
which also makes ni = xi. Equations (10.11) and (10.12) on the other hand are new and vital.
Known as summability relations, they allow the calculation of mixture properties from partial
properties, playing a role opposite to that of Eq. (10.7), which provides for the calculation of
partial properties from mixture properties.

356

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

One further important equation follows directly from Eqs. (10.10) and (10.11).
­Differentiation of Eq. (10.11), a general expression for M, yields a general expression for dM:
	​
dM = ​∑​ ​​x​i​d​​M¯​​  i​​ + ​∑​ ​​​M¯​​  i​​ d​x​i​​	
i

i

Combining this equation with Eq. (10.10) yields the Gibbs/Duhem2 equation:
∂M
∂M
	​​​​ ​___
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dP + ​ ​___
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ dT − ​∑​ ​​x​i​ d​​M¯​​  i​​ = 0​​	
( ∂ P )T, x
( ∂ T )P, x
i

(10.13)

This equation must be satisfied for all changes occurring in a homogeneous phase. For the
important special case of changes in composition at constant T and P, it simplifies to:
	​​​∑​ ​​x​i​d​​M¯​​  i​​ = 0​    ​​(​const T, P​)​​	

(10.14)

i

Eq. 10.14 shows that the partial molar properties cannot all vary independently. This
constraint is analogous to the constraint on mole fractions, which are not all independent
because they must sum to one. Similarly, the mole-fraction-weighted sum of the partial molar
properties must yield the overall solution property (Eq. 10.11), and this constrains the variation in partial molar properties with composition.

A Rationale for Partial Properties
Central to applied solution thermodynamics, the partial-property concept implies that a
solution property represents a “whole,” i.e., the sum of its parts as represented by partial
properties M
​​​ ¯​​  i​​​of the constituent species. This is the implication of Eq. (10.11), and it is a
proper interpretation provided one understands that the defining equation for M
​​​ ¯​​  i​​​ Eq. (10.7) is
an apportioning formula which arbitrarily assigns to each species i its share of the solution
property.3
The constituents of a solution are in fact intimately intermixed, and owing to molecular
interactions they cannot have private properties of their own. Nevertheless, partial properties,
as defined by Eq. (10.7), have all the characteristics of properties of the individual species as
they exist in solution. Thus for practical purposes they may be assigned as property values to
the individual species.
Partial properties, like solution properties, are functions of composition. In the limit as
a solution becomes pure in species i, both M and ​​​M¯​​  i​​​approach the pure-species property Mi.
Mathematically,
	​
​lim​​ M = ​lim​​​​M¯​​  i​​ = ​M​i​​	
​x​i​→1

​x​i​→1

2Pierre-Maurice-Marie Duhem (1861–1916), French physicist. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre Duhem.
3Other apportioning equations, which make different allocations of the solution property, are possible and are, in
principle, equally valid.

357

10.3. Partial Properties

For a partial property of a species that approaches its infinite-dilution limit, i.e., a partial property value of a species as its mole fraction approaches zero, we can make no general
statements. Values come from experiment or from models of solution behavior. Because it is
an important quantity, we do give it a symbol, and by definition we write:
	​​​M¯​​  i∞
​  ​ ≡ ​lim​​ ​​M¯​​  i​​​	
​x​i​→0

The essential equations of this section are thus summarized as follows:
∂ ​(​nM​)​
Definition:	​​​M¯​​  i​​ ≡ ​ ______

(10.13)

which shows that the partial properties of species making up a solution are not independent of
one another.

Partial Properties in Binary Solutions
An equation for a partial property as a function of composition can always be derived from
an equation for the solution property by direct application of Eq. (10.7). For binary systems,
however, an alternative procedure may be more convenient. Written for a binary solution, the
summability relation, Eq. (10.11), becomes:
	​
M = ​x​1​​​M¯​​  1​​ + ​x​2​​​M¯​​  2​​​	

(A)

Whence,	​
dM = ​x​1​d​​M¯​​  1​​ + ​​M¯​​  1​​ d​x​1​+ ​x​2​d​​M¯​​  2​​ + ​​M¯​​  2​​  d​x​2​​

(B)

When M is known as a function of x1 at constant T and P, the appropriate form of the Gibbs/
Duhem equation is Eq. (10.14), expressed here as:
	​
​x​1​ d​​M¯​​  1​​ + ​x​2​ d​​M¯​​  2​​ = 0​	

(C)

Because x1 + x2 = 1, it follows that dx1 = −dx2. Eliminating dx2 in favor of dx1 in Eq. (B) and
combining the result with Eq. (C) gives:
dM
____
	​
​ ​= ​​M¯​​  1​​ − ​​M¯​​  2​​​	
d​x​1​
Two equivalent forms of Eq. (A) result from the elimination separately of x1 and x2:
	​
M = ​​M¯​​  1​​ − ​x​2​(​​M¯​​  1​​ − ​​M¯​​  2​​ ) and M = ​x​1​(​​M¯​​  1​​ − ​​M¯​​  2​​ ) + ​​M¯​​  2​​​	

(D)

358

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

In combination with Eq. (D) these become:
dM
​​​ ¯​​  1​​ = M + ​x​2​____
M
​ ​ (10.15)
d​x​1​

dM
​​​ ¯​​  2​​ = M − ​x​1​____
M
​ ​ (10.16)
d​x​1​

Thus for binary systems, the partial properties are readily calculated directly from an expression for the solution property as a function of composition at constant T and P. The corresponding equations for multicomponent systems are much more complex. They are given in
detail by Van Ness and Abbott.4
Equation (C), the Gibbs/Duhem equation, may be written in derivative forms:
d​​M¯​​  1​​
d​​M¯​​  2​​

d​​M​​  1​​

​

1

(F)

Clearly, when M
​​​ ¯​​  1​​​ and M
​​​ ¯​​  2​​​ are plotted vs. x1, the slopes must be of opposite sign. Moreover,
d​​M¯​​  1​​
d​​M¯​​  2​​
	​
​lim​​____
​ 
 ​ = 0 (Provided ​lim​​____
​ 
 ​ is finite)​	
​x​1​→1 d​x​1​
​x​1​→1 d​x​1​
Similarly,
d​​M¯​​  2​​
d​​M¯​​  1​​
	​
​lim​​____
​ 
 ​ = 0 (Provided ​lim​​____
​ 
 ​ is finite )​	
​x​2​→1 d​x​1​
​x​2​→1 d​x​1​
Thus, plots of M
​​​ ¯​​  1​​​ and M
​​​ ¯​​  2​​​ vs. x1 become horizontal as each species approaches purity.
Finally, given an expression for ​​​M¯​​  1​​​(​​x​1​)​​, integration of Eq. (E) or Eq. (F) yields an
expression for M
​​​ ¯​​  2​​​(​x​1​)​ that satisfies the Gibbs/Duhem equation. This means that expressions
cannot be specified independently for both ​​​M¯​​  1​​​(​x​1​)​​ and M
​​​ ¯​​  2​​​(​x​1​)​​.

Thus, the tangent intercepts give directly the values of the two partial properties.
These intercepts of course shift as the point of tangency moves along the curve,
and the limiting values are indicated by the constructions shown in Fig. 10.1(b).
For the tangent line drawn at x1 = 0 (pure species 2), M
​​​ ¯​​  2​​ = ​M​2​, and at the opposite
intercept, M
​​​ ¯​​  1​​ = M

Example 10.3
The need arises in a laboratory for 2000 cm3 of an antifreeze solution consisting of
30 mol-% methanol in water. What volumes of pure methanol and of pure water at
25°C must be mixed to form the 2000 cm3 of antifreeze, also at 25°C? Partial molar volumes for methanol and water in a 30 mol-% methanol solution and their pure-species
molar volumes, both at 25°C, are:

The summability relation, Eq. (10.11), is written for the molar volume of the

Example 10.4
The enthalpy of a binary liquid system of species 1 and 2 at fixed T and P is represented by the equation:
	​
H = 400​x​1​+ 600​x​2​+ ​x​1​​x​2(​​40​x​1​+ 20​x​2)​​​
where H is in J·mol–1. Determine expressions for H

Solution 10.4
Replacing x2 by 1 – x1 in the given equation for H and simplifying gives:
	​​H = 600 − 180 ​x​1​− 20 ​x​  13​  ​​​
and
dH

361

10.3. Partial Properties
Then,
	​​​H¯​​  1​​ = 600 − 180​x​1​− 20​x​  13​  ​ − 180​x​2​− 60​x​  12​  ​​x​2​​
Replacing x2 with 1 – x1 and simplifying:
	​​​​H¯​​  1​​ = 420 − 60​x​  12​  ​ + 40​x​  13​  ​​​

(B)

By Eq. (10.16),
dH
	​​​H¯​​  2​​ = H − ​x​1​____
​ ​= 600 − 180​x​1​− 20​x​  13​  ​ + 180​x​1​+ 60​x​  13​  ​​
d​x​1​
or
	​​​​H¯​​  2​​ = 600 + 40​x​  13​  ​​​

(C)

One can equally well start with the given equation for H. Because dH/dx1 is a
total derivative, x2 is not a constant. Also, x2 = 1 – x1; therefore dx2/dx1 = –1.
­Differentiation of the given equation for H therefore yields:
dH
____
	​
​ ​= 400 − 600 + ​x​1​​x​2​(​40 − 20​)​+ ​(​40 ​x​1​+ 20 ​x​2​)​(​− ​x​1​+ ​x​2​)​​
d​x​1​
Replacing x2 with 1 – x1 reproduces the expression previously obtained.
A numerical value for H1 results by substitution of x1 = 1 in either Eq. (A) or
(B). Both equations yield H1 = 400 J·mol–1. Similarly, H2 is found from either
Eq. (A) or (C) when x1 = 0. The result is H2 = 600 J·mol–1. The infinite-dilution
values H
​​​ ¯​​  1∞​  ​​ and ​​​H¯​​  2∞​  ​​are found from Eqs. (B) and (C) when x1 = 0 in Eq. (B) and
x1 = 1 in Eq. (C). The results are: H
​​​ ¯​​  1∞​  ​ = 420 ​J·mol​​−1​​and H
​​​ ¯​​  2∞​  ​ = 640 ​J·mol​​−1​
Exercise: Show that the partial properties as given by Eqs. (B) and (C) combine
by summability to give Eq. (A) and that they conform to all requirements of the
Gibbs/Duhem equation.

These equations allow us to calculate the effects of P and T on the partial Gibbs energy (or
chemical potential). They are the partial-property analogs of Eqs. (10.4) and (10.5). Many
additional relationships among partial properties can be derived in the same ways that relationships among pure species properties were derived in earlier chapters. More generally, one
can prove the following:
Every equation that provides a linear relation among thermodynamic
properties of a constant-composition solution has as its counterpart
an equation connecting the corresponding partial properties of each
­species in the solution.
An example is based on the equation that defines enthalpy: H = U + PV. For n moles,
	​
nH = nU + P​​(​nV​)​​
Differentiation with respect to ni at constant T, P, and nj yields:

By the definition of partial properties, Eq. (10.7), this becomes:

which is the partial-property analog of Eq. (2.10).
In a constant-composition solution, ​​​G¯​​  i​​​is a function of T and P, and therefore:

This may be compared with Eq. (6.11). These examples illustrate the parallelism that exists
between equations for a constant-composition solution and the corresponding equations for
the partial properties of the species in solution. We can therefore write simply by analogy
many equations that relate partial properties.

10.4. The Ideal-Gas-State Mixture Model

10.4

THE IDEAL-GAS-STATE MIXTURE MODEL

Despite its limited ability to describe actual mixture behavior, the ideal-gas-state mixture
model provides a conceptual basis upon which to build the structure of solution thermodynamics. It is a useful property model because it:
∙ Has a molecular basis.
∙ Approximates reality in the well-defined limit of zero pressure.
∙ Is analytically simple.
At the molecular level, the ideal-gas state represents a collection of molecules that do not
interact and occupy no volume. This idealization is approached for real molecules in the limit
of zero pressure (which implies zero density) because both the energies of intermolecular
interactions and the volume fraction occupied by the molecules go to zero with increasing
separation of the molecules. Although they do not interact with one another, molecules in
the ideal-gas state do have internal structure; it is differences in molecular structure that give
rise to differences in ideal-gas-state heat capacities (Sec. 4.1), enthalpies, entropies, and other
properties.
Molar volumes in the ideal-gas state are Vig = RT/P [Eq. (3.7)] regardless of the
nature of the gas. Thus for the ideal-gas state, whether of pure or mixed gases, the molar v­ olume
is the same for given T and P. The partial molar volume of species i in the ­ideal-gas-state
mixture is found from Eq. (10.7) applied to the volume; superscript ig denotes the ideal-gas
state:

where the final equality depends on the equation ​n = ​n​i​+ ​∑​j​​n​j​. This result means that for the
ideal-gas state at given T and P the partial molar volume, the pure-species molar volume, and
the mixture molar volume are identical:
RT
ig
ig
	​​​V¯​​  i​  ​= ​V​  i​  ​= ​V​ig​= ___

We define the partial pressure of species i in the ideal-gas-state mixture (pi) as the
pressure that species i would exert if it alone occupied the molar volume of the mixture. Thus,5

​ ig ​= ​y​i​P ​(​i = 1, 2, . . ., N​)​​
​V​ ​
where yi is the mole fraction of species i. The partial pressures obviously sum to the total
pressure.
Because the ideal-gas-state mixture model presumes molecules of zero volume that
do not interact, the thermodynamic properties (other than molar volume) of the constituent
5Note that this definition does not make the partial pressure a partial molar property.

364

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

species are independent of one another, and each species has its own set of private properties.
This is the basis for the following statement of Gibbs’s theorem:
A partial molar property (other than volume) of a constituent species in
an ideal-gas-state mixture is equal to the corresponding molar property
of the species in the pure ideal-gas state at the mixture temperature but
at a pressure equal to its partial pressure in the mixture.
This is expressed mathematically for generic partial property ​​​M¯​​  i​  ​≠ ​​V¯​​  i​  ​​by the equation:
ig

ig

ig
ig
	​​​M¯​​  i​  ​​(​T, P​)​= ​M​  i​  ​​(​T, ​p​i​)​​

Enthalpy in the ideal-gas state is independent of pressure; therefore
ig
ig
ig

ig

	​​​H¯​​  i​  ​= ​H​  i​  ​​	

(10.22)

ig
where ​​H​  i​  ​​is the pure-species value at the mixture T. An analogous equation applies for Uig

and other properties that are independent of pressure.
Entropy in the ideal-gas state does depend on pressure, as expressed by Eq. (6.24),
restricted to constant temperature:
ig

	​
d​S​  i​  ​= − Rd ln P   ​​(​const T​)​​
This provides the basis for computing the entropy difference between a gas at its
partial pressure in the mixture and at the total pressure of the mixture. Integration from pi to
P gives:
P

ig
	​​S​  i​  ​​(​T, P​)​− ​S​  i​  ​​(​T, ​p​i​)​= − R ln __

​y​i​P
Whence,
ig

ig

	​​S​  i​  ​​(​T, ​p​i​)​= ​S​  i​  ​​(​T, P​)​− R ln ​y​i​​
Comparing this with Eq. (10.21), written for the entropy, yields:
ig
ig
	​​​S¯​​  i​  ​​(​T, P​)​= ​S​  i​  ​​(​T, P​)​− R ln ​y​i​​

or
ig

ig
ig
	​​​G¯​​  i​  ​= ​​H¯​​  i​  ​− T ​​S¯​​  i​  ​​

Differentiation of this equation in accord with Eqs. (10.18) and (10.19) confirms the results
expressed by Eqs. (10.20) and (10.23).
The summability relation, Eq. (10.11), with Eqs. (10.22), (10.23), and (10.24) yields:

Equations analogous to Eq. (10.25) may be written for both ​​C​  P​  ​​and ​V​ig​. The former
appears as Eq. (4.7), but the latter reduces to an identity because of Eq. (10.20).
When Eq. (10.25) is written,
ig

	​
​H​ig​− ​∑​ ​​y​i​​H​  i​  ​= 0​
i

the difference on the left is the enthalpy change associated with a process in which appropriate
amounts of the pure species at T and P are mixed to form one mole of mixture at the same T
and P. For the ideal-gas state, this enthalpy change of mixing is zero.
When Eq. (10.26) is rearranged as:

​S​ig​− ​∑​ ​​y​i​S​  i​  ​= R​∑​ ​​y​i​ln __

the left side is the entropy change of mixing for the ideal-gas state. Because 1/yi > 1, this
quantity is always positive, in agreement with the second law. The mixing process is inherently irreversible, so the mixing process must increase the total entropy of the system and
surroundings together. For ideal-gas-state mixing at constant T and P, using Eq. (10.25) with
an energy balance shows that no heat transfer will occur between the system and surroundings.
Therefore, the total entropy change of system plus surroundings is only the entropy change of
mixing.

An alternative expression for the chemical potential μ​ 
​​ i​  ​​results when G​

where Γi(T), the integration constant at constant T, is a species-dependent function of temperature only.6 Equation (10.24) is now written:

ig

(10.29)

where the argument of the logarithm is the partial pressure. Application of the summability relation, Eq. (10.11), produces an expression for the Gibbs energy for the ideal-gas-state
mixture:

​G​ig​≡ ​∑​ ​​y​i​​Γ​i​(​T​)​+ RT ​∑​ ​​y​i​ln ​(​​y​i​P​)​​

These equations, remarkable in their simplicity, provide a full description of ideal-gas-state
behavior. Because T, P, and {yi} are the canonical variables for the Gibbs energy, all other
thermodynamic properties for the ideal-gas model can be generated from them.

10.5

FUGACITY AND FUGACITY COEFFICIENT: PURE SPECIES

As is evident from Eq. (10.6), the chemical potential μi provides the fundamental criterion
for phase equilibrium. This is true as well for chemical-reaction equilibria. However, it exhibits characteristics that discourage its direct use. The Gibbs energy, and hence μi, is defined
in relation to internal energy and entropy. Because absolute values of internal energy are
ig
unknown, the same is true for μi. Moreover, Eq. (10.29) shows that μ​ 
​​ i​  ​​approaches negative
infinity when either P or yi approaches zero. This is true not only for the ideal-gas state, but
for any gas. Although these characteristics do not preclude the use of chemical potentials, the
application of equilibrium criteria is facilitated by the introduction of the fugacity,7 a property
that takes the place of μi but does not exhibit its less desirable characteristics.
The origin of the fugacity concept resides in Eq. (10.28), valid only for pure species i in
the ideal-gas state. For a real fluid, we write an analogous equation that defines fi, the fugacity
of pure species i:
	​
​G​i​≡ ​Γ​i ​(​T​)​+ RT ln ​fi​​​	

(10.31)

This new property fi , with units of pressure, replaces P in Eq. (10.28). Clearly, if Eq. (10.28)
is viewed as a special case of Eq. (10.31), then:
ig

	​​f​  i​  ​= P​	

(10.32)

6A dimensional ambiguity is evident with Eq. (10.28) and with analogous equations to follow in that P has units,
whereas ln P must be dimensionless. This difficulty is more apparent than real, because the Gibbs energy is always
expressed on a relative scale, absolute values being unknown. Thus in application only differences in Gibbs energy
appear, leading to ratios of quantities with units of pressure in the argument of the logarithm. The only requirement is
that consistency of pressure units be maintained.
7This quantity originated with Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875–1946), American physical chemist, who also
developed the concepts of the partial property and the ideal solution. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert N.
Lewis.

367

10.5. Fugacity and Fugacity Coefficient: Pure Species

and the fugacity of pure species i in the ideal-gas state is necessarily equal to its pressure.
Subtraction of Eq. (10.28) from Eq. (10.31), both written for the same T and P, gives:
​fi​​
ig
	​
​G​i​− ​G​  i​  ​= RT ln __
​ ​​
P

ig

By the definition of Eq. (6.41), ​G​i​− ​G​  i​  ​​is the residual Gibbs energy, ​​G​  i​  ​​; thus,

	​​​G​  iR​  ​= RT ln _
​ ​= RT ln ​ϕi​​​​

(10.33)

where the dimensionless ratio fi/P has been defined as another new property, the fugacity
coefficient, given by symbol ϕi:
​fi​​
	​
​ϕi​​≡ _
​ ​​	
(10.34)
P
These equations apply to pure species i in any phase at any condition. However, as a ­special
case they must be valid for the ideal-gas state, for which G​ 
​​ iR​  ​ = 0, ​ϕi​​ = 1​, and Eq. (10.28) is
recovered from Eq. (10.31). Moreover, we may write Eq. (10.33) for P = 0 and combine it
with Eq. (6.45):
​G​  R​  ​
	​
​lim​​ ​​​ ___
​  i  ​ ​​​ = ​lim​​ ln ​ϕi​​= J​
P→0 ( RT )
P→0
As explained in connection with Eq. (6.48), the value of J is immaterial and is set equal to
zero. Whence,

(P)
P→0

​fi​​

Fugacity coefficients (and therefore fugacities) for pure gases are evaluated by this equation

Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium for Pure Species
Equation (10.31), which defines the fugacity of pure species i, may be written for species i as
a saturated vapor and as a saturated liquid at the same temperature:
​​G​iv​  ​= ​Γ​i​​(​T​)​+ RT ln ​f​iv​  ​​ (10.37)

​​G​il​  ​= ​Γ​i​​(​T​)​+ RT ln ​f​il​  ​​ (10.38)

By difference,
​f​  v​  ​
	​​G​  iv​  ​− ​G​  il​  ​= RT ln __
​  il ​​
​f​  i​  ​
This equation applies to the change of state from saturated liquid to saturated vapor, at temperature T and at the vapor pressure P​ 
​​ isat
​  ​​. According to Eq. (6.83), G​ 
​​ iv​  ​− ​G​  il​  ​= 0​; therefore:
	​​f​  iv​  ​= ​f​  il​  ​= ​f​  isat
​  ​​	

(10.39)

where f​​ ​  isat
​  ​​indicates the value for either saturated liquid or saturated vapor. C
­ oexisting phases
of saturated liquid and saturated vapor are in equilibrium; Eq. (10.39) therefore expresses a
fundamental principle:
For a pure species, coexisting liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium
when they have the same temperature, pressure, and fugacity.8
An alternative formulation is based on the corresponding fugacity coefficients:
​f​  sat
​  ​
	​​ϕ​  isat
​  ​ = ____
​  i sat ​​	
​P​  i​  ​

(10.40)

Whence,
	​​ϕ​  iv​  ​= ​ϕ​  il​  ​= ​ϕ​  isat
​  ​​	

(10.41)

This equation, expressing the equality of fugacity coefficients, is an equally valid criterion of vapor/liquid equilibrium for pure species.
8The word fugacity is based on a Latin root meaning to flee or escape, also the basis for the word fugitive. Thus
fugacity has been interpreted to mean “escaping tendency.” When the escaping tendency is the same for the two
phases, they are in equilibrium. When the escaping tendency of a species is higher in one phase than another, that
species will tend to transfer to the phase where its fugacity is lower.

Fugacity of a Pure Liquid
The fugacity of pure species i as a compressed (subcooled) liquid may be calculated as the
product of the saturation pressure with three ratios that are each relatively easy to evaluate:

All terms are at the temperature of interest. Inspection reveals that cancellation of

Ratio (A) is the vapor-phase fugacity coefficient of pure vapor i at its vapor/liquid saturation pressure, designated ϕ​

As shown by Eq. (10.39), expressing the equality of liquid and vapor fugacities at

liquid i. This effect is generally small. The basis for its calculation is Eq. (6.11), integrated at

Equation (A) may now be applied to states of superheated steam at 300°C for various
values of P from 1 kPa to the saturation pressure of 8592.7 kPa. For example, at
P = 4000 kPa and 300°C:
	​
​H​i​= 2962.0 J⋅​g​−1​ ​Si​​= 6.3642 J⋅​g​−1​⋅K​​−1​​
Values of H and S must be multiplied by the molar mass of water (18.015 g⋅mol−1)
to put them on a molar basis for substitution into Eq. (A):
​fi​​ 18.015 ______________

​fi​​= ​(​3611.0​)​(​​f​*​)​= ​(​3611.0​)​(​1 kPa​)​= 3611.0 kPa​
Thus the fugacity coefficient at 4000 kPa is:

Similar calculations at other pressures lead to the values plotted in Fig. 10.2 at
pressures up to the saturation pressure ​​P​  isat
​  ​ = 8592.7 kPa​. At this pressure,
	​​ϕ​  isat
​  ​ = 0.7843 and f​​  isat
​  ​ = 6738.9 kPa​
According to Eqs. (10.39) and (10.41), the saturation values are unchanged by
condensation. Although the plots are therefore continuous, they do show discontinuities in slope. Values of fi and ϕi for liquid water at higher pressures are found
by application of Eq. (10.44), with ​​V​  il​  ​​equal to the molar volume of saturated
liquid water at 300°C:
	​​V​  il​  ​= ​(1.403)​(18.015)​= 25.28​cm​​3​⋅mol​​−1​​
At 10,000 kPa, for example, Eq. (10.44) becomes:
​(​25.28​)​(​10,000 − 8592.7​)​

​fi​​= (0.7843)(8592.7) exp

​(​8314​)​(​573.15​)​
The fugacity coefficient of liquid water at these conditions is:
	​
​ϕi​​= ​fi​​/ P = 6789.8 / 10,000 = 0.6790​
Such calculations allow the completion of Fig. 10.2, where the solid lines show
how fi and ϕi vary with pressure.
The curve for fi starts at the origin and deviates increasingly from the dashed

discontinuity in slope, and the curve then rises very slowly with increasing pressure, indicating that the fugacity of liquid water at 300°C is a weak function of
pressure. This behavior is characteristic of a liquid at a temperature well below
its critical temperature. The fugacity coefficient ϕi decreases steadily from its
zero-pressure value of unity as the pressure rises. Its rapid decrease in the liquid
region is a consequence of the near-constancy of the fugacity itself.

10.6 FUGACITY AND FUGACITY COEFFICIENT:
SPECIES IN SOLUTION
The definition of the fugacity of a species in solution is parallel to the definition of the
pure-species fugacity. For species i in a mixture of real gases or in a solution of liquids, the
equation analogous to Eq. (10.29), the ideal-gas-state expression, is:
	​
​μ​i​≡ ​Γ​i​​(T)​+ RT ln ​​fˆ​​  i​​​	

(10.46)

373

10.6. Fugacity and Fugacity Coefficient: Species in Solution

where f​​​ ˆ​​i​​​is the fugacity of species i in solution, replacing the partial pressure yiP. This
­definition of ​​​fˆ​​  i​​​does not make it a partial molar property, and it is therefore identified by a
circumflex rather than by an overbar.
A direct application of this definition indicates its potential utility. Equation (10.6), the
equality of μi in every phase, is the fundamental criterion for phase equilibrium. Because all
phases in equilibrium are at the same temperature, an alternative and equally general criterion
follows immediately from Eq. (10.46):
β
	​​​​fˆ​​  iα​  ​= ​​fˆ​  ​  i​  ​= ⋯ = ​​fˆ​​  iπ​  ​​      ​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​​	

(10.47)

Thus, multiple phases at the same T and P are in equilibrium when the
fugacity of each constituent species is the same in all phases.
This is the criterion of equilibrium most often applied in the solution of ­phase-equilibrium
problems.
For the specific case of multicomponent vapor/liquid equilibrium, Eq. (10.47) becomes:
	​​​fˆ​​  il​  ​= ​​fˆ​​  iv​  ​ ​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​​	

(10.48)

Equation (10.39) results as a special case when this relation is applied to the vapor/liquid equilibrium of pure species i.
The definition of a residual property is given in Sec. 6.2:
	​
​M​R​≡ M − ​M​ig​​	

(6.41)

where M is the molar (or unit-mass) value of a thermodynamic property and Mig is the value

that the property would have in its ideal-gas state with the same composition at the same T
and P. The defining equation for a partial residual property M
​​​ ¯​​  iR​  ​​follows from this equation.
Multiplied by n mol of mixture, it becomes:
	​
n ​M​R​= nM − n ​M​ig​​
Differentiation with respect to ni at constant T, P, and nj gives:
∂ (n ​M​​)

Reference to Eq. (10.7) shows that each term has the form of a partial molar property. Thus,
ig
	​​​M¯​​  iR​  ​= ​​M¯​​  i​​ − ​​M¯​​  i​  ​​	

(10.49)

Because residual properties measure departures from ideal-gas-state values, their most logical
and common application is to gas-phase properties, but they are also valid for describing
liquid-phase properties. Written for the residual Gibbs energy, Eq. (10.49) becomes:
ig
	​​​​G¯​​  iR​  ​= ​​G¯​​  i​​ − ​​G¯​​  i​  ​​​	

(10.50)

an equation which defines the partial residual Gibbs energy.
Subtracting Eq. (10.29) from Eq. (10.46), both written for the same T and P, yields:
​​fˆ​​  i​​
ig
​μ​i​− ​μ​  i​  ​= RT ln ____
​   ​​
​y​i​P

374

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

This result combined with Eq. (10.50) and the identity ​μ​i​≡ ​​G¯​​  i​​​ gives:
	​​​​G¯​​  iR​  ​= RT ln ​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​​	

(10.51)

where by definition,
​​fˆ​​  i​​
	​​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​ ≡ ____
​   ​​​	
​y​i​P

(10.52)

The dimensionless ratio ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​ is called the fugacity coefficient of species i in solution. Although
most commonly applied to gases, the fugacity coefficient may also be used for liquids, and in
this case mole fraction yi is replaced by xi, the symbol traditionally used for mole fractions in
the liquid phase. Because Eq. (10.29) for the ideal-gas state is a special case of Eq. (10.46):
ig
	​​​fˆ​​  i​  ​= ​y​i​P​	

(10.53)

Thus the fugacity of species i in an ideal-gas-state mixture is equal to its partial pressure.
ig
Moreover, ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​  ​= 1​, and for the ideal-gas state, G
​​​¯​​  iR​  ​= 0​.

The Fundamental Residual-Property Relation
The fundamental property relation given by Eq. (10.2) is put into an alternative form through
the mathematical identity [also used to generate Eq. (6.37)]:
nG

nG
	​
d​ _
​ ​ ​≡ ___
​ ​d(nG ) − ____
​ 2 ​dT​	
( RT ) RT
R ​T​ ​
In this equation d(nG) is eliminated by Eq. (10.2) and G is replaced by its definition,
H − TS. The result, after algebraic reduction, is:
nG

( RT ) RT

R ​T​ ​
i

(10.54)

All terms in Eq. (10.54) have the units of moles; moreover, in contrast to Eq. (10.2), the
enthalpy rather than the entropy appears on the right side. Equation (10.54) is a general
­relation expressing nG/RT as a function of all of its canonical variables, T, P, and the mole
numbers. It reduces to Eq. (6.37) for the special case of 1 mol of a constant-composition
phase. Equations (6.38) and (6.39) follow from either equation, and equations for the other
thermodynamic properties then come from appropriate defining equations. Knowledge of
G/RT as a function of its canonical variables allows evaluation of all other thermodynamic
properties, and therefore implicitly contains complete property information. Unfortunately,
we do not have the experimental means by which to exploit this characteristic. That is, we
cannot directly measure G/RT as a function of T, P, and composition. However, we can obtain
complete thermodynamic information by combining calorimetric and volumetric data. In this
regard, an analogous equation relating residual properties proves useful.
Because Eq. (10.54) is general, it may be written for the special case of the ideal-gas state:

10.6. Fugacity and Fugacity Coefficient: Species in Solution

In view of the definitions of residual properties [Eqs. (6.41) and (10.50)], subtracting this
equation from Eq. (10.54) gives:

(10.55)

Equation (10.55) is the fundamental residual-property relation. Its derivation from Eq. (10.2)
parallels the derivation in Chap. 6 that led from Eq. (6.11) to Eq. (6.42). Indeed, Eqs. (6.11)
and (6.42) are special cases of Eqs. (10.2) and (10.55), valid for 1 mol of a constant-composition
fluid. An alternative form of Eq. (10.55) follows by introduction of the fugacity coefficient as
given by Eq. (10.51):
n ​G​R​

(10.56)

Equations so general as Eqs. (10.55) and (10.56) are most useful for practical application in restricted forms. Division of Eqs. (10.55) and (10.56), first, by dP with restriction to
constant T and composition, and second, by dT and restriction to constant P and composition
leads to:

These equations are restatements of Eqs. (6.43) and (6.44) wherein the restriction of the derivatives to constant composition is shown explicitly. They lead to Eqs. (6.46), (6.48), and (6.49)
for the calculation of residual properties from volumetric data. Moreover, Eq. (10.57) is the
basis for the direct derivation of Eq. (10.35), which yields fugacity coefficients from volumetric data. It is through the residual properties that this kind of experimental information enters
into the practical application of thermodynamics.
In addition, from Eq. (10.56),

PVT data.

Fugacity Coefficients from the Virial Equation of State
Values of ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​ for species i in solution are readily found from equations of state. The simplest
form of the virial equation provides a useful example. Written for a gas mixture it is exactly
the same as for a pure species:

	​

(3.36)

The mixture second virial coefficient B is a function of temperature and composition. Its exact
composition dependence is given by statistical mechanics, which makes the virial equation
preeminent among equations of state where it is applicable, i.e., to gases at low to moderate
pressures. The equation giving this composition dependence is:
	​
​B = ​∑​ ​​∑​ ​​y​i​​y​j​​B​ij​​	
i

(10.61)

j

where yi and yj represent mole fractions in a gas mixture. The indices i and j identify ­species,
and both run over all species present in the mixture. The virial coefficient Bij characterizes bimolecular interactions between molecules of species i and species j, and therefore ​B​ij​ = ​B​ji​​. The
double summation accounts for all possible bimolecular interactions.
For a binary mixture i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2; the expansion of Eq. (10.61) then gives:
	​
B = ​y​1​​y​1​B​11​+ ​y​1​y​2​B​12​+ ​y​2​y​1​B​21​+ ​y​2​y​2​B​22​​

10.6. Fugacity and Fugacity Coefficient: Species in Solution

Two types of virial coefficients have appeared: B11 and B22, for which the successive subscripts are the same, and B12, for which the two subscripts are different. The first type is a
pure-species virial coefficient; the second is a mixture property, known as a cross coefficient.
Both are functions of temperature only. Expressions such as Eqs. (10.61) and (10.62) relate
mixture coefficients to pure-species and cross coefficients. They are called mixing rules.
Equation (10.62) allows the derivation of expressions for l​ n ​​ϕˆ​​  1​​ and ln ​​ϕˆ​​  2​​​for a binary gas
mixture that obeys Eq. (3.36). Written for n mol of gas mixture, it becomes:

Another method, and the one adopted by Lee and Kesler to extend their correlation to fugacity
coefficients, is based on an equation of state.
Equation (10.66) may also be written,
	​
ϕ = (​ϕ​0​)​(​ϕ​1​)​ω​​	

(10.67)

and we have the option of providing correlations for ​ϕ​0​and ​ϕ​1​rather than for their logarithms.

This is the choice made here, and Tables D.13 through D.16 present values for these quantities as derived from the Lee/Kesler correlation as functions of Tr and Pr, thus providing a
three-parameter generalized correlation for fugacity coefficients. Tables D.13 and D.15 for ​ϕ​0​​
can be used alone as a two-parameter correlation which does not incorporate the refinement
introduced by the acentric factor.

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

Solution 10.8
At these conditions, with Tc = 420.0 K, Pc = 40.43 bar from Table B.1, we have:
	​
​Tr​​= 1.127 ​Pr​​= 1.731

ω = 0.191​

By interpolation in Tables D.15 and D.16 at these conditions,
	​
​ϕ​0​= 0.627 and ​ϕ​1​= 1.096​
Equation (10.67) then gives:
	​
ϕ = (0.627) ​(1.096)​​0.191​= 0.638​
and
	​
​f = ϕP = ​(​0.638​)​(​70​)​= 44.7 bar​​
A useful generalized correlation for ln ϕ results when the simplest form of the virial equation
is valid. Equations (3.57) and (3.59) combine to give:
​Pr​​
	​
Z − 1 = ___
​ ​(​B​0​+ ω ​B​1​)​
​Tr​​
Substitution into Eq. (10.65) and integration yield:
​Pr​​
	​
ln ϕ = ___
​ ​(​B​0​+ ω​B​1​)​
​Tr​​
or
​Pr​​
	​
ϕ = exp ​ _
​ ​(​B​0​+ ω ​B​1​)​ ​​	
[ ​Tr​​
]

(10.68)

This equation, used in conjunction with Eqs. (3.61) and (3.62), provides reliable values of ϕ
for any nonpolar or slightly polar gas when applied at conditions where Z is approximately
linear in pressure. Figure 3.13 again serves as a guide to its applicability.
Named functions HRB(TR,PR,OMEGA) and SRB(TR,PR,OMEGA) for the ­evaluation
of HR/RTc and SR/R by the generalized virial-coefficient correlation are described in
Sec. 6.4. Similarly, we introduce here a function named PHIB(TR,PR,OMEGA) for the
­evaluation of ϕ11:
	​
ϕ = PHIB(TR,PR,OMEGA)​	
It combines Eq. (10.68) with Eqs. (3.61) and (3.62) to evaluate the fugacity coefficient for
given reduced temperature, reduced pressure, and acentric factor. For example, the value of ϕ
for carbon dioxide at the conditions of Example 6.4, Step 3, is denoted as:
	​
PHIB(0.963,0.203,0.224) = 0.923​
11Sample programs and spreadsheets for the evaluation of these functions are available in the Online Learning

10.7. Generalized Correlations for the Fugacity Coefficient

Extension to Mixtures
The generalized correlation just described is for pure gases only. The remainder of this section
shows how the virial equation may be generalized to allow the calculation of fugacity coefficients ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​  i​​​for species in gas mixtures.
The general expression for calculation of ​ln ​​ϕˆ​​  k​​​from second-virial-coefficient data is
given by Eq. (10.64). Values of the pure-species virial coefficients Bkk, Bii, etc., are found
from the generalized correlation represented by Eqs. (3.58), (3.59), (3.61), and (3.62). The
cross coefficients Bik, Bij, etc., are found from an extension of the same correlation. For this
purpose, Eq. (3.59) is rewritten in the more general form:12
	​​​Bˆ​​  ij​​ = ​B​0​+ ​ω​ij​​B​1​​	

(10.69a)

where
​B​ij​​P​cij​
	​​​Bˆ​​  ij​​ ≡ ______
​
​​	
R​T​cij​

(10.69b)

and B0 and B1 are the same functions of Tr as given by Eqs. (3.61) and (3.62). The combining
rules proposed by Prausnitz et al. for the calculation of ωij, Tcij, and Pcij are:
​ω​i​+ ​ω​j​

In Eq. (10.71), kij is an empirical interaction parameter specific to a particular i-j molecular
pair. When i = j and for chemically similar species, kij = 0. Otherwise, it is a small positive
number evaluated from minimal PVT data or, in the absence of data, set equal to zero. When
i = j, all equations reduce to the appropriate values for a pure species. When i ≠ j, these equations
define a set of interaction parameters that, while they do not have any fundamental physical
significance, do provide useful estimates of fugacity coefficients in moderately non-ideal gas
mixtures. Reduced temperature is given for each ij pair by ​T​rij​≡ T / ​T​cij​. For a mixture, values of
Bij from Eq. (10.69b) substituted into Eq. (10.61) yield the mixture second virial coefficient B,
and substituted into Eq. (10.64) [Eqs. (10.63) for a binary] they yield values of l​n ​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​.
The primary virtue of the generalized correlation for second virial coefficients presented
here is simplicity; more accurate, but more complex, correlations appear in the literature.13

10.8 THE IDEAL-SOLUTION MODEL
The chemical potential as given by the ideal-gas-state mixture model,
ig
ig
ig
	​​​μ​  i​  ​≡ ​​G¯​​  i​  ​= ​G​  i​  ​(T, P) + RT ln ​y​i​​​	

(10.24)

383

10.8. The Ideal-Solution Model

contains a final term that gives it the simplest possible composition dependence. Indeed, this
functional form could reasonably serve as the basis for the composition dependence of chemical potential in dense gases and liquids. In it, the composition dependence arises only from
the entropy increase due to random intermixing of molecules of different species. This entropy
increase due to mixing is the same in any random mixture, and thus can be expected to be
present in liquids and dense gases as well. However, the pure-species behavior implied by the
ig
term G
​​ ​  i​  ​(T, P)​is unrealistic except for the ideal-gas state. A natural extension of Eq. (10.24)
ig
therefore replaces ​​G​  i​  ​(T, P)​​with Gi(T, P), the Gibbs energy of pure i in its real physical state
of gas, liquid, or solid. Thus, we define an ideal solution as one for which:
	​​​μ​  iid​  ​≡ ​​G¯​​  iid​  ​= ​G​  i​ ​(​  T, P) + RT ln ​x​i​​​	

(10.75)

where superscript id denotes an ideal-solution property. Mole fraction is here represented by xi
to reflect the fact that this approach is most often applied to liquids. However, a consequence
of this definition is that an ideal-gas-state mixture is a special case, namely, an ideal solution
of gases in the ideal-gas state, for which xi in Eq. (10.75) is replaced by yi.
All other thermodynamic properties for an ideal solution follow from Eq. (10.75). The
partial volume results from differentiation with respect to pressure at constant temperature and
composition in accord with Eq. (10.18):
∂ ​​G¯​​  id​  ​
∂ ​G​i​
	​​​V¯​​  iid​  ​= ​​​ ​____
​  i  ​​​ ​​  ​​ = ​ ____
​​   ​​ ​​  ​​​	
(
∂
P
∂ P )T
(
)T, x
By Eq. (10.4), (∂Gi/∂P)T = Vi; whence,
	​​​​V¯​​  iid​  ​= ​V​i​​​	

(10.76)

Similarly, as a result of Eq. (10.19),
∂ ​​G¯​​  id​  ​
∂ ​G​i​
	​​​S¯​​  iid​  ​= − ​​​ ​____
​  i  ​​​ ​​  ​​ = − ​ ​____
​   ​​ ​​  ​​ − R ln ​x​i​​	
( ∂ T )P
( ∂ T )P, x
By Eq. (10.5),
	​​​​S¯​​  iid​  ​= ​Si​​− R ln ​x​i​​​	

(10.77)

Because H
​​​ ¯​​  iid​  ​= ​​G¯​​  iid​  ​+ T ​​S¯​​  iid​  ​​, substitutions by Eqs. (10.75) and (10.77) yield:
	​​​H¯​​  iid​  ​= ​G​i​+ RT ln ​x​i​+ T ​Si​​− RT ln ​x​i​​	
or
	​​​​H¯​​  iid​  ​= ​H​i​​​	

(10.78)

The summability relation, Eq. (10.11), applied to the special case of an ideal solution,
is written:
	​
​M​id​= ​∑​ ​​x​i​​​M¯​​  iid​  ​​	
i

384

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

Application to Eqs. (10.75) through (10.78) yields:
​G​id​= ​∑​ ​x​i​G​i​+ RT​∑​ ​x​i​ln ​x​i​ (10.79)
i

i

​V​id​= ​∑​ ​​x​i​​V​i​

(10.81)

i

i

i

​H​id​= ​∑​ ​​x​i​​H​i​

(10.82)

i

Note the similarity of these equations to Eq. (10.25), (10.26), and (10.27) for
ideal-gas-state mixtures. For all properties of an ideal solution, the composition dependence
is, by definition, the same as that of ideal-gas-state mixtures, for which this composition
dependence is well defined and arises entirely from the entropy increase of random mixing.
However, the temperature and pressure dependence are not those of ideal gases but are given by
mole-fraction-weighted averages of the pure species properties.
If in Example 10.3 the solution formed by mixing methanol(1) and water(2) were
assumed ideal, the final volume would be given by Eq. (10.81), and the V-vs.-x1 relation
would be a straight line connecting the pure-species volumes, V2 at x1 = 0 with V1 at x1 = 1.
For the specific calculation at x1 = 0.3, the use of V1 and V2 in place of partial volumes yields:
	​​​V​  1t ​​  = 983   ​  V
​ ​  2t ​​​  = 1017 ​cm​​3​​	
Both values are about 3.4% low.

The Lewis/Randall Rule
The composition dependence of the fugacity of a species in an ideal solution is particularly
simple. Recall Eqs. (10.46) and (10.31):
​μ​i​≡ ​Γ​i​(T) + RT ln ​​fˆ​​  i​​​

(10.46)

​G​i​≡ ​Γ​i​(T) + RT ln ​fi​​

(10.31)

Subtraction yields the general equation:
	​
​μ​i​= ​G​i​+ RT ln (​​fˆ​​  i​​ / ​fi​​)​	
For the special case of an ideal solution,
​​ ​  iid​  ​≡ ​​G¯​​  iid​  ​= Gi + RT ln (​​fˆ​​  iid
μ
​  ​/ ​fi​​)​
Comparison with Eq. (10.75) gives:
	​​​​fˆ​​  iid
​  ​= ​x​i​​fi​​​​	

(10.83)

This equation, known as the Lewis/Randall rule, applies to each species in an ideal solution
at all conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition. It shows that the fugacity of each
species in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction; the proportionality constant is
the fugacity of pure species i in the same physical state as the solution and at the same T and P.

385

10.9. Excess Properties

Division of both sides of Eq. (10.83) by Pxi and substitution of ϕ
​​​ˆ​​  iid​  ​​ for f​​​ ˆ​​  iid
​  ​/ ​x​i​​P​i​​ [Eq. (10.52)]
and of ϕi for fi/P [Eq. (10.34)] gives an alternative form:
	​​​ϕˆ​​  iid​  ​= ​ϕi​​​	

(10.84)

Thus the fugacity coefficient of species i in an ideal solution is equal to the fugacity coefficient of pure species i in the same physical state as the solution and at the same T and P.
Phases comprised of liquids whose molecules are of similar size and similar chemical nature
approximate ideal solutions. Mixtures of isomers closely conform to these conditions. Mixtures of adjacent members of homologous series are also examples.

10.9 EXCESS PROPERTIES
The residual Gibbs energy and the fugacity coefficient are directly related to experimental
PVT data by Eqs. (6.49), (10.35), and (10.60). Where such data can be adequately correlated
by equations of state, thermodynamic-property information is readily provided by residual
properties. However, liquid solutions are often more easily dealt with through properties that
measure their departures, not from ideal-gas-state behavior, but from ideal-solution behavior.
Thus the mathematical formalism of excess properties is analogous to that of the residual
properties, but with ideal-solution behavior rather than ideal-gas-state behavior as a basis.
If M represents the molar (or unit-mass) value of any extensive thermodynamic property
(e.g., V, U, H, S, G, etc.), then an excess property ME is defined as the difference between the
actual property value of a solution and the value it would have as an ideal solution at the same
temperature, pressure, and composition. Thus,
	​
​M​E​≡ M − ​M​id​​	

(10.85)

For example,
	​
​G​E​≡ G − ​G​id​ ​ ​H​E​≡ H − ​H​id​ ​ ​S​E​≡ S − ​S​id​​	
Moreover,
	​
​G​E​= ​H​E​− T ​S​E​​	

(10.86)

which follows from Eq. (10.85) and Eq. (6.4), the definition of G.
The definition of ME is analogous to the definition of a residual property as given by
Eq. (6.41). Indeed, excess properties have a simple relation to residual properties, found by
subtracting Eq. (6.41) from Eq. (10.85):
	​
​M​E​− ​M​R​= − (​M​id​− Mig )​	
As already noted, ideal-gas-state mixtures are ideal solutions of pure gases in the ideal-gas
state. Equations (10.79) through (10.82) therefore become expressions for Mig when Mi is
i𝗀
replaced by M​ 
​​ i​  ​. Equation (10.82) becomes Eq. (10.25), Eq. (10.80) becomes Eq. (10.26), and
Eq. (10.79) becomes Eq. (10.27). The two sets of equations, for Mid and Mig, therefore provide
a general relation for the difference:
ig

	​
​M​id​− ​M​​  ig​= ​∑​ ​​x​i​​M​i​− ​∑​ ​​x​i​​M​  i​  ​= ​∑​ ​​x​i​​M​  iR​  ​​	
i

i

i

386

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

This leads immediately to:
	​
​M​E​= ​M​R​− ​∑​ ​​x​i​​M​  iR​  ​​	

(10.87)

i

Note that excess properties have no meaning for pure species, whereas residual properties
exist for pure species as well as for mixtures.
The partial-property relation analogous to Eq. (10.49) is:
	​​​M¯​​  iE​  ​= ​​M¯​​  i​​ − ​​M¯​​  iid​  ​​	

(10.88)

where M
​​​ ¯​​  iE​  ​​is a partial excess property. The fundamental excess-property relation is derived

in exactly the same way as the fundamental residual-property relation and leads to analogous
results. Equation (10.54), written for the special case of an ideal solution, is subtracted from
Eq. (10.54) itself, yielding:
​​G¯​​  E​  ​
n ​G​E​
n ​V​E​
n ​H​E​

​
​ ​= ​_​dP − _
​ 2 ​dT + ​∑​ ​___
​  i  ​ d​n​i​​​	
( RT ) RT
RT
R ​T​ ​
i

(10.89)

This is the fundamental excess-property relation, analogous to Eq. (10.55), the fundamental
residual-property relation.
The exact analogy that exists between properties M, residual properties MR, and excess
properties ME is indicated by Table 10.1. All of the equations that appear are basic property
relations, although only Eqs. (10.4) and (10.5) have been shown explicitly before.

​​ ​  PE​  ​​is a constant, independent of T, find expressions for GE, SE, and HE as
functions of T.
(b) From the equations developed in part (a), find values for GE, SE, and HE for an
equimolar solution of benzene(1)/n-hexane(2) at 323.15 K, given the following

The Nature of Excess Properties
Peculiarities of liquid-mixture behavior are dramatically revealed in the excess properties.
Those of primary interest are GE, HE, and SE. The excess Gibbs energy comes from experiment through reduction of vapor/liquid equilibrium data (Chap. 13), and HE is determined by
mixing experiments (Chap. 11). The excess entropy is not measured directly but is found from
Eq. (10.86), written:
​H​E​− ​G​E​
	​
​S​E​= _______
​
​​	
T
Excess properties are often strong functions of temperature, but at normal temperatures
they are not strongly influenced by pressure. Their composition dependence is illustrated in
Fig. 10.3 for six binary liquid mixtures at 50°C and approximately atmospheric pressure. To
present SE with the same units and on the same scale as HE and GE, the product TSE is shown
rather than SE itself. Although the systems exhibit a diversity of behavior, they have common
features:
1. All excess properties become zero as either species approaches purity.
2. Although GE vs. x1 is approximately parabolic in shape, both HE and TSE exhibit individualistic composition dependencies.
3. When an excess property ME has a single sign (as does GE in all six cases), the extreme
value of ME (maximum or minimum) often occurs near the equimolar composition.

Feature 1 is a consequence of the definition of an excess property, Eq. (10.85); as any
xi approaches unity, both M and Mid approach Mi, the corresponding property of pure species
i. Features 2 and 3 are generalizations based on observation and admit exceptions (note, for
example, the behavior of HE for the ethanol/water system).

SYNOPSIS

After studying this chapter, including the end-of-chapter problems, one should be able to:
∙ Define, in words and in symbols, chemical potential and partial properties
∙ Compute partial properties from mixture properties
∙ Recall that two phases are in equilibrium, at fixed T and P, when the chemical potential
of each species is the same in both phases
∙ Apply the summability relation to compute mixture properties from partial properties

390

CHAPTER 10 . The Framework of Solution Thermodynamics

∙ Recognize that partial properties cannot vary independently, but are constrained by the
Gibbs/Duhem equation
∙ Understand that all linear relationships among thermodynamic properties of pure species also apply to partial properties of species in a mixture
∙ Compute partial properties of a mixture in the ideal-gas state
∙ Define and use fugacity and fugacity coefficients for pure species and for species
in a mixture, and recognize that these are defined for convenience in solving phaseequilibrium problems
∙ Compute fugacities and fugacity coefficients of pure species from PVT data or generalized correlations
∙ Estimate fugacity coefficients of species in gas mixtures using second virial coefficient
correlations
∙ Recognize that the ideal-solution model provides a reference for description of liquid mixtures
∙ Relate partial properties in an ideal solution to corresponding pure species properties
∙ Define and use excess properties of species in a mixture

10.1. What is the change in entropy when 0.7 m3 of CO2 and 0.3 m3 of N2, each at 1 bar and
25°C, blend to form a gas mixture at the same conditions? Assume ideal gases.
10.2. A vessel, divided into two parts by a partition, contains 4 mol of nitrogen gas at 75°C
and 30 bar on one side and 2.5 mol of argon gas at 130°C and 20 bar on the other. If
the partition is removed and the gases mix adiabatically and completely, what is the
change in entropy? Assume nitrogen to be an ideal gas with CV = (5/2)R and argon to
be an ideal gas with CV = (3/2)R.
10.3. A stream of nitrogen flowing at a rate of 2 kg·s−1 and a stream of hydrogen flowing
at a rate of 0.5 kg·s−1 mix adiabatically in a steady-flow process. If the gases are
assumed ideal, what is the rate of entropy increase as a result of the process?
10.4. What is the ideal work for the separation of an equimolar mixture of methane and
ethane at 175°C and 3 bar in a steady-flow process into product streams of the pure
gases at 35°C and 1 bar if Tσ = 300 K?
10.5. What is the work required for the separation of air (21-mol-% oxygen and 79-mol-%
nitrogen) at 25°C and 1 bar in a steady-flow process into product streams of pure
oxygen and nitrogen, also at 25°C and 1 bar, if the thermodynamic efficiency of the
process is 5% and if Tσ = 300 K?

10.11. Problems

10.6. What is the partial molar temperature? What is the partial molar pressure? Express
results in relation to the T and P of the mixture.
10.7. Show that:
(a) The “partial molar mass” of a species in solution is equal to its molar mass.
(b) A partial specific property of a species in solution is obtained by division of the
partial molar property by the molar mass of the species.
10.8. If the molar density of a binary mixture is given by the empirical expression:
ρ​ = ​a​0​+ ​a​1​​x​1​+ ​a​2​​x​  12​  ​​
		 find the corresponding expressions for ​​​V¯​​  1​​​ and V
​​​ ¯​​  2​​​
10.9. For a ternary solution at constant T and P, the composition dependence of molar property M is given by:
	​
M = ​x​1​​M​1​+ ​x​2​​M​2​+ ​x​3​​M​3​+ ​x​1​​x​2​​x​3​C​
		where M1, M2, and M3 are the values of M for pure species 1, 2, and 3, and C is a
parameter independent of composition. Determine expressions for M
​​​ ¯​​  1​​, ​​M¯​​  2​​, and ​​M¯​​  3​​​ by
application of Eq. (10.7). As a partial check on your results, verify that they satisfy
the summability relation, Eq. (10.11). For this correlating equation, what are the M

V
		where yi is the mole fraction of species i in the gas mixture, Zi is evaluated at pi and
T, and V is the molar volume of the gas mixture. Note that pi as defined here is not
a partial pressure yiP, except for an ideal gas. Dalton’s “law” of additive pressures
states that the total pressure exerted by a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the purecomponent pressures of its constituent species: P
​ = ​∑​i​​p​i​. Show that Dalton’s “law”
implies that Z
​ = ​∑​i​​y​i​​Z​i​​, where Zi is the compressibility factor of pure species i
evaluated at the mixture temperature but at its pure-component pressure.
10.11. If for a binary solution one starts with an expression for M (or MR or ME) as a
function of x1 and applies Eqs. (10.15) and (10.16) to find M

Mixing Processes

Homogeneous mixtures of different chemical species, particularly liquids, are formed in many
ways in both natural and industrial processes. Moreover, “unmixing” processes are required
for the separation of mixtures into their constituent species and for the purification of individual chemicals. The thermodynamic properties of mixtures are required for the analysis of
these mixing and unmixing processes. It is therefore our purpose in this brief chapter to:
∙ Define a standard mixing process and develop the property changes that accompany it
∙ Relate properties of a mixture to the properties of its constituents as pure species
∙ Relate property changes of mixing to excess properties
∙ Treat in detail the heat effects of mixing and “unmixing” processes

11.1

PROPERTY CHANGES OF MIXING

Mixing processes are carried out in many ways, and each process results in a particular change
of state, depending on initial and final conditions of temperature and pressure. For the rational
study of mixtures, we must define a standard mixing process, much as we have done for
standard property changes of chemical reaction. Experimental feasibility suggests mixing
at constant T and P. Thus, we take as a standard mixing process one in which appropriate
amounts of pure chemical species at T and P are mixed to yield a uniform mixture of specified
composition, also at T and P. The pure species are said to be in their standard states, and their
properties in this state are the pure-species properties Vi, Hi, Si, etc.
The standard mixing process is represented schematically in Fig. 11.1 for mixing pure
species 1 and 2.1 In this hypothetical device, n1 moles of pure species 1 are mixed with n2
moles of pure species 2 to form a homogeneous solution of composition x1 = n1/(n1 + n2).
The observable phenomena accompanying the mixing process are expansion (or contraction)
1This conceptual illustration is not a practical device for making such measurements. In practice, volume changes
of mixing can be measured directly using calibrated glassware (e.g., graduated cylinders) and heats of mixing are
measured calorimetrically.

and a temperature change. Expansion is accommodated by movement of the piston so as to
maintain pressure P, and temperature change is compensated by heat transfer to restore
temperature T.
When mixing is complete, the total volume change of the system (as measured by piston
displacement d) is:
	​
Δ​V​t​= ​(​n​1​+ ​n​2​)​V − ​n​1​V​1​− ​n​2​V​2​​
Because the process occurs at constant pressure, the heat transfer Q is equal to the total
enthalpy change of the system:
	​
Q = Δ​H​t​= ​(​n​1​+ ​n​2​)​H − ​n​1​​H​1​− ​n​2​​H​2​​
Division of these equations by n1 + n2 gives:
Δ​V​t​
	​
ΔV ≡ V − ​x​1​​V​1​− ​x​2​​V​2​= ______

and
Q
	​
ΔH ≡ H − ​x​1​​H​1​− ​x​2​​H​2​= ______
​
​​
​n​1​+ ​n​2​
Thus the volume change of mixing ΔV and the enthalpy change of mixing ΔH are found from
the measured quantities ΔVt and Q. Because of its experimental association with Q, ΔH is
usually called the heat of mixing.
Equations analogous to those for ΔV and ΔH can be written for any property, and they
may also be generalized to apply to the mixing of any number of species:
	​
​ΔM ≡ M − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​M​i​​	
i

(11.1)

where M can represent any intensive thermodynamic property of the mixture, for example,
U, CP, S, G, or Z. Equation (11.1) is thus the defining equation for a class of thermodynamic
properties, known as property changes of mixing.

402

CHAPTER 11. Mixing Processes

Property changes of mixing are functions of T, P, and composition and are directly
related to excess properties. This result follows by combination of Eq. (10.85) with each
of Eqs. (10.79) through (10.82), which provide expressions for the properties of an ideal
solution:
	​
​M​E​≡ M − ​M​id​​	

(10.85)

	​
​V​E​= V − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​V​i​​	

(11.2)

	​
​H​E​= H − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​H​i​​	

(11.3)

	​
​S​E​= S − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​Si​​+ R ​∑​ ​​x​i​ln  ​x​i​​	

(11.4)

​G​E​= G − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​G​i​− RT ​∑​ ​​x​i​ln  ​x​i​​	

(11.5)

i

i

i

i

i

i

The first two terms on the right side of each equation represent a property change of mixing as
defined by Eq. (11.1). Equations (11.2) through (11.5) can therefore be written:
​V​E​= ΔV​

(11.6)

​H​E​= ΔH​

(11.7)

​S​E​= ΔS + R​∑​ ​​ ​x​i​ln ​x​i​

(11.8)

​G​E​= ΔG − RT​∑​ ​​ ​x​i​ln ​x​i​

(11.9)

i

i

For the special case of an ideal solution, each excess property is zero, and these equations
become:
​Δ​V​id​= 0​

(11.10)

​Δ​H​id​= 0​

(11.11)

​Δ​S​id​= − R​∑​ ​​ ​x​i​ln ​x​i​
i

(11.12)

​Δ​G​id​= RT​∑​ ​​x​i​ln ​x​i​
i

(11.13)

These equations are alternative forms of Eqs. (10.79) through (10.82). They apply as
well to the ideal-gas-state mixture as a special case of an ideal solution.
Equations (11.6) through (11.9) show that excess properties and property changes of
mixing are readily calculated one from the other. Although historically property changes of
mixing were introduced first, because of their direct relation to experiment, excess ­properties
fit more readily into the theoretical framework of solution thermodynamics. Because of
their direct measurability, ΔV and ΔH are the property changes of mixing of major interest.
­Moreover, they are identical with the corresponding excess properties VE and HE.
Figure 11.2 shows excess enthalpies HE for the ethanol/water system as a function of
composition for several temperatures ranging from 30°C to 110°C. For the lower temperatures
the behavior is exothermic, with heat removal required for isothermal mixing. For the higher
temperatures the behavior is endothermic, with heat addition required for isothermal mixing.
At intermediate temperatures, regions of both exothermic and endothermic behavior appear.
Data of this sort are often represented by polynomial equations in mole fraction, multiplied by
x1x2 to ensure that the excess property goes to zero for both pure components.

Figure 11.3 illustrates the composition dependence of ΔG, ΔH, and TΔS for six binary
liquid systems at 50°C and atmospheric pressure. The related quantities GE, HE, and TSE were
shown for the same systems in Fig. 10.3. As with excess properties, property changes of mixing exhibit diverse behavior, but most systems have common features:
1. Each ΔM is zero for a pure species.
2. The Gibbs energy change of mixing ΔG is always negative.
3. The entropy change of mixing ΔS is positive.
Feature 1 follows from Eq. (11.1). Feature 2 is a consequence of the requirement that
the Gibbs energy be a minimum for an equilibrium state at specified T and P, as discussed in
Sec. 12.4. Feature 3 reflects the fact that negative entropy changes of mixing are unusual; it
is not a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, which merely forbids negative
entropy changes of mixing for systems isolated from their surroundings. For constant T and
P, ΔS is observed to be negative for certain special classes of mixtures, none of which is
­represented in Fig. 11.3.

with M = ME. Thus,

11.2

HEAT EFFECTS OF MIXING PROCESSES

The heat of mixing, defined in accord with Eq. (11.1), is:
	​
ΔH = H − ​∑​ ​​x​i​​H​i​​	
i

(11.16)

Equation (11.16) gives the enthalpy change when pure species are mixed at constant T and P
to form one mole (or a unit mass) of solution. Data are most commonly available for binary
systems, for which Eq. (11.16) solved for H becomes:
	​
H = ​x​1​​H​1​+ ​x​2​​H​2​+ ΔH​	

(11.17)

This equation provides for the calculation of the enthalpies of binary mixtures from enthalpy
data for pure species 1 and 2 and heats of mixing.
Data for heats of mixing are usually available for only a limited number of temperatures.
If the heat capacities of the pure species and of the mixture are known, heats of mixing are
calculated for other temperatures by a method analogous to the calculation of standard heats of
reaction at elevated temperatures from the value at 25°C.
Heats of mixing are similar in many respects to heats of reaction. When a chemical
reaction occurs, the energy of the products is different from the energy of the reactants at the

406

CHAPTER 11. Mixing Processes

same T and P because of the chemical rearrangement of the constituent atoms. When a mixture is formed, a similar energy change occurs because of changes in the interactions between
molecules. That is, heats of reaction arise from changes in intramolecular interactions while
heats of mixing arise from changes in intermolecular interactions. Intramolecular interactions (chemical bonds) are generally much stronger than intermolecular interactions (arising
from electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, etc.) and as a result, heats of reaction are
usually much larger in magnitude than heats of mixing. Large values of heats of mixing are
observed when the intermolecular interactions in the solution are much different than in the
pure components. Examples include systems with hydrogen bonding interactions and systems
containing electrolytes that dissociate in solution.

Enthalpy/Concentration Diagrams
An enthalpy/concentration (H–x) diagram is a useful way to represent enthalpy data for binary
solutions. It plots enthalpy as a function of composition (mole fraction or mass fraction of
one species) for a series of isotherms, all at a fixed pressure (usually 1 standard atmosphere).
Equation (11.17) solved for H is directly applicable to each isotherm:
	​
H = ​x​1​​H​1​+ ​x​2​​H​2​+ ΔH​
Values of H for the solution depend not only on heats of mixing, but also on enthalpies H1 and
H2 of the pure species. Once these are established for each isotherm, H is fixed for all solutions because ΔH has unique and measurable values for all compositions and temperatures.
Because absolute enthalpies are unknown, arbitrary zero-point conditions are chosen for the
enthalpies of the pure species, and this establishes the basis of the diagram. The preparation
of a complete H–x diagram with many isotherms is a major task, and relatively few have been
published.2 Figure 11.4 presents a simplified H–x diagram for sulfuric acid(1)/water(2) mixtures, with only three isotherms.3 The basis for this diagram is H = 0 for the pure species at
298.15 K, and both the composition and enthalpy are on a mass basis.
A useful feature of an enthalpy/concentration diagram is that all solutions formed by
adiabatic mixing of two other solutions are represented by points lying on a straight line connecting the points that represent the initial solutions. This is shown as follows.
Let subscripts a and b identify two initial binary solutions, consisting of na and nb moles
or unit masses, respectively. Let subscript c identify the final solution obtained by adiabatic
mixing of solutions a and b, for which ΔHt = Q = 0, and the total energy balance is:
	​
​(​n​a​+ ​n​b​)​Hc​ ​= ​n​a​​Ha​ ​+ ​n​b​​H​b​​
On an enthalpy/concentration diagram these solutions are represented by points designated a, b, and c, and our purpose is to show that point c lies on the straight line that passes
through points a and b. For a line that passes through both points a and b,
	​
​Ha​ ​= m ​x​1a​+ k
and

​H​b​= m ​x​1b​+ k​

Substituting these expressions into the preceding material balance yields:
​(​n​a​+ ​n​b​)​Hc​ ​ = ​n​a​(​m ​x​  1a​​ + k​)​+ ​n​b​(​m​x​  1b​​ + k​)​

By a material balance for species 1,
	​
​(​n​a​+ ​n​b​)​x​  1c​​ = ​n​a​​x​  1a​​ + ​n​b​​x​  1b​​​
Combining this equation with the preceding one gives, after reduction:
	​
​Hc​ ​= m ​x​  1c​​ + k​
showing that point c lies on the same straight line as points a and b. This feature can be used
to graphically estimate the final temperature when two solutions are mixed adiabatically. Such
a graphical estimation is illustrated in Fig. 11.4 for the process of mixing 10 wt.% H2SO4 at
300 K (point a) with pure H2SO4 at 300 K (point b) in a 3.5:1 ratio, to yield a 30 wt% H2SO4
solution (point c). The graphical construction shows that after adiabatic mixing, the temperature will be nearly 350 K.
Because the pure-species enthalpies H1 and H2 are arbitrary, when only a single isotherm is considered, they may be set equal to zero, in which case Eq. (11.17) becomes:
	​
H = ΔH = ​H​E​​
An HE–x diagram then serves as an enthalpy/concentration diagram for a single temperature. There are many such single-temperature diagrams in the literature, and they are usually
accompanied by an equation that represents the curve. An example is the diagram of Fig. 11.5,
showing data for sulfuric acid/water at 25°C. Again, ​x​​H​2​S​O​4​​ is the mass fraction of sulfuric
acid and HE is on a unit-mass basis.

The isotherm shown in Fig. 11.5 is represented by the equation

	​
​H​E​= ​(​− 735.3 − 824.5 ​x​1​+ 195.2 ​x​12​  ​− 914.6 ​x​13​  ​)​x​1​(​1 − ​x​1​)​​

(A)

The numbers adjacent to points on the graph come from this equation. The form of this
equation is typical of models for excess properties: a polynomial in composition ­multiplied by
x1 and x2. The x1x2 product ensures that the excess property goes to zero for both pure components. Alone, it would take the form of a symmetric parabola with a maximum or minimum at
x1 = 0.5. Multiplication by a polynomial in x1 scales and biases the symmetric parabola.
A simple problem is to find the quantity of heat that must be removed to restore the
initial temperature (25°C) when pure water is mixed continuously with a 90% aqueous solution of sulfuric acid to dilute it to 50%. The calculation may be made with the usual material
and energy balances. We take as a basis 1 kg of 50% acid produced. If ma is the mass of 90%
acid, a mass balance on the acid is 0.9ma = 0.5, from which ma = 0.5556. The energy balance
for this process, assuming negligible kinetic- and potential-energy changes, is the difference
between the final and initial enthalpies:
	​
Q = ​HE​f​  ​− (​H​aE​  ​)​​(​m​a​)​= − 303.3 − ​(​−178.7​)​(​0.5556​)​= − 204.0 kJ​
where the enthalpy values are shown on Fig. 11.5.
An alternative procedure is represented by the two straight lines on Fig. 11.5, the first for
adiabatic mixing of pure water with the 90% aqueous solution of acid to form a 50% solution.
The enthalpy of this solution lies at ​x​​H​2​SO4​= 0.5​on the line connecting the points representing
the unmixed species. This line is a direct proportionality, from which ​H​E​= ​(​− 178.7 / 0.9​)​(​0.5​)​=
− 99.3​. The temperature at this point is well above 25°C, and the vertical line represents cooling
to 25°C, for which Q
​ = Δ​H​E​= − 303.3 − ​(​−99.3​)​= − 204.0 kJ​. Because the initial step is adiabatic, this cooling step gives the total heat transfer for the process, indicating that 204 kJ⋅kg−1
are removed from the system. The temperature rise upon adiabatic mixing cannot be obtained
directly from a diagram like this with a single isotherm, but it can be estimated if one knows the
approximate heat capacity of the final solution.

409

11.2. Heat Effects of Mixing Processes

Equation (A) can be used in Eq. (11.14) and (11.15) to generate values of the partial excess
¯ E ​ ​O​at 25°C. This produces the results shown in Fig. 11.6, where all
enthalpies ​​​H¯​​  E​H ​

values are on a unit-mass basis. The two curves are far from symmetric, a consequence of the
skewed nature of the HE curve. At high concentrations of H2SO4, ​​​H¯​​  E​H ​
​2​O​reaches high values, in
fact the infinite-dilution value approaches the latent heat of water. This is the reason that when
water is added to pure sulfuric acid, a very high rate of heat removal is required for isothermal
mixing. Under usual circumstances the heat-transfer rate is far from adequate, and the resulting
temperature rise causes local boiling and sputtering. This problem does not arise when acid is

Heats of Solution
When solids or gases are dissolved in liquids, the heat effect is called a heat of solution and
is based on the dissolution of 1 mol of solute. If species 1 is the solute, then x1 is the moles of
solute per mole of solution. Because ΔH is the heat effect per mole of solution, ΔH/x1 is the
heat effect per mole of solute. Thus,
ΔH
˜ ​= ____
	​​ΔH
​ ​​
​x​1​
where Δ
​​ ˜
H​​is the heat of solution on the basis of one mole of solute.
Solution processes are conveniently represented by physical-change equations analogous to chemical-reaction equations. When 1 mol of LiCl(s) is mixed with 12 mol of H2O, the
process is represented by:
	​
LiCl​​(​s​)​+ 12​H​2​O​​(​l​)​→ LiCl​​(​12​H​2​O​)​​
The designation LiCl(12H2O) represents a solution of 1 mol of LiCl dissolved in
12 mol of H2O. The heat of solution for this process at 25°C and 1 bar is ΔH
​​˜ ​ = − 33,614 J​.
This means that the enthalpy of 1 mol of LiCl in 12 mol of H2O is 33,614 J less than the

CHAPTER 11. Mixing Processes

combined enthalpies of 1 mol of pure LiCl(s) and 12 mol of pure H2O(l). Equations for physical changes such as this are readily combined with equations for chemical reactions. This is
illustrated in the following example, which incorporates the dissolution process just described.

Example 11.3
Calculate the heat of formation of LiCl in 12 mol of H2O at 25°C.

Solution 11.3
The process implied by the problem statement results in the formation from its
constituent elements of 1 mol of LiCl in solution in 12 mol of H2O. The equation
representing this process is obtained as follows:
° ​
Li + _​  12 ​​Cl​  2​​ → LiCl(s)

​ = − 442,224 J

The first reaction describes a chemical change resulting in the formation of
LiCl(s) from its elements, and the enthalpy change accompanying this reaction is
the standard heat of formation of LiCl(s) at 25°C. The second reaction represents
the physical change resulting in the dissolution of 1 mol of LiCl(s) in 12 mol of
H2O(l), and the enthalpy change is a heat of solution. The overall enthalpy change,
−442,224 J, is the heat of formation of LiCl in 12 mol of H2O. This figure does
not include the heat of formation of the H2O.
Often heats of solution are not reported directly but must be determined from heats of formation by the reverse of the calculation just illustrated. Typical are data for the heats of formation

11.2. Heat Effects of Mixing Processes

Heats of solution are readily calculated from these data. The reaction representing the
dissolution of 1 mol of LiCl(s) in 5 mol of H2O(l) is obtained as follows:

H​​  298​​ = −28,195 J

This calculation can be carried out for each quantity of H2O for which data are given.
The results are then conveniently represented graphically by a plot of ΔH
​​ ˜ ​​, the heat of solution
per mole of solute, vs. n​​˜ ​​, the moles of solvent per mole of solute. The composition variable,​​
n˜ ​≡ ​n​2​/ ​n​1​, is related to x1:

Because water of hydration in solids is an integral part of a chemical compound, the heat
of formation of a hydrated salt includes the heat of formation of the water of hydration. The
dissolution of 1 mol of LiCl⋅2H2O(s) in 8 mol of H2O produces a solution containing 1 mol
LiCl in 10 mol of H2O, represented by LiCl(10H2O). The equations which sum to give this

11.2. Heat Effects of Mixing Processes

Solution 11.4
The 2 kg of 15% LiCl solution entering the evaporator each second consists of
0.30 kg LiCl and 1.70 kg H2O. A material balance shows that 1.25 kg of H2O
is evaporated and that 0.75 kg of 40% LiCl solution is produced. The process is
represented by Fig. 11.8.

Figure 11.8: Process of Example 11.4.

The energy balance for this flow process is ΔHt = Q, where ΔHt is the total
enthalpy of the product streams minus the total enthalpy of the feed stream. Thus
the problem reduces to finding ΔHt from available data. Because enthalpy is a
state function, the computational path for ΔHt is immaterial and is selected for
convenience and without reference to the actual path followed in the evaporator.
The data available are heats of solution of LiCl in H2O at 25°C (Fig. 11.7), and the
calculational path shown in Fig. 11.9 allows their direct use.
The enthalpy changes for the individual steps shown in Fig. 11.9 must add to
give the total enthalpy change:
	​
Δ​H​t​= Δ​H​at ​+ Δ​H​bt ​+ Δ​H​ct ​+ Δ​H​dt ​​
The individual enthalpy changes are determined as follows:
∙	​
Δ ​H​at ​: This step involves the separation of 2 kg of a 15% LiCl solution into its pure
constituents at 25°C. For this “unmixing” process the heat effect is the same as for
the corresponding mixing process but is of opposite sign. For 2 kg of 15% LiCl
solution, the moles of material entering are:
​(​0.15​)​(​2000​)​

	​
​
​= 7.077 mol LiCl​ ___________

Thus the solution contains 13.33 mol of H2O per mole of LiCl. From Fig. 11.7
the heat of solution per mole of LiCl for ~

“unmixing” of 2 kg of solution,
	​
Δ ​H​at ​= ​(​+33,800​)​(​7.077​)​= 239,250 J​

∙	​
Δ​H​bt ​: This step results in the mixing of 0.45 kg of water with 0.30 kg of LiCl(s) to
form a 40% solution at 25°C. This solution comprises:
	​
​0.30 kg → 7.077 mol LiCl​

and​

0.45 kg → 24.979 mol ​H​2​O​​

Thus the final solution contains 3.53 mol of H2O per mole of LiCl. From

​ ​= 3.53 is −23,260 J. Therefore,
n​
	​
Δ​H​bt ​= ​(​−23,260​)​(​7.077​)​= − 164,630 J​
∙	​
Δ​H​ct ​: For this step 0.75 kg of 40% LiCl solution is heated from 25 to 132°C. Because
CP is taken to be constant, ​Δ ​H​ct ​= m ​CP​ ​ΔT​,
	​
Δ​H​ct ​= ​(​0.75​)​(​2.72​)​(​132 − 25​)​= 218.28 kJ = 218,280 J​
∙	​
Δ ​H​dt ​​: In this step liquid water is vaporized and heated to 132°C. The enthalpy
change is obtained from the steam tables:
	​
Δ​H​dt ​= ​(​1.25​)​(​2740.3 − 104.8​)​= 3294.4 kJ = 3,294,400 J​

11.4. Problems

Adding the individual enthalpy changes gives:
ΔH = Δ ​H​at ​+ Δ ​H​bt ​+ Δ ​H​ct ​+ Δ ​H​dt ​
	​
   
​ ​ ​
​
​​
​ = 239,250 − 164,630 + 218,280 + 3,294,400 = 3,587,300 J
The required heat-transfer rate is therefore ​3587.3 kJ⋅ ​s​−1​. Although the enthalpy
of vaporization of water dominates the overall heat requirement, the heat effect
associated with the difference in heat of solution at the initial and final concentration is not negligible.

Phase Equilibrium:
Introduction

The analysis of phase equilibrium provides the primary motivation for development of the
framework of solution thermodynamics and for the creation of models of mixture properties
to be used with this framework. As a practical matter, preferential segregation of chemical
species in a particular phase provides the basis for nearly all industrial processes for separation and purification of materials, from the distillation of petroleum or alcoholic beverages
to the crystallization of pharmaceutical compounds to the capture of carbon dioxide from
power plant effluent. As a result, the analysis of phase equilibrium problems is one of the core
competencies expected of a chemical engineer. The present chapter focuses on the qualitative
description of equilibrium between fluid phases. Chapter 13 then presents the tools required
for quantitative analysis of vapor/liquid equilibrium. Chapter 15 treats other types of phase
equilibrium in greater detail.

12.1

THE NATURE OF EQUILIBRIUM

Equilibrium is a condition in which no changes occur in the macroscopic properties of an
isolated system with time. At equilibrium, all potentials that may cause change are exactly
balanced, so no driving force exists for any change in the system. An isolated system consisting of liquid and vapor phases in intimate contact eventually reaches a final state wherein no
tendency exists for change to occur within the system. The temperature, pressure, and phase
compositions reach final values which thereafter remain fixed. The system is in equilibrium.
Nevertheless, at the microscopic level, conditions are not static. The molecules comprising a phase at a given instant are not the same molecules that later occupy the same phase.
Molecules constantly pass from one phase to the other. However, the average rate of passage
of molecules is the same in both directions, and no net interphase transfer of material occurs.
In engineering practice, the assumption of equilibrium is justified when it leads to results
of satisfactory accuracy. For example, in the reboiler for a distillation column, equilibrium
between vapor and liquid phases is commonly assumed. For finite vaporization rates this is an
approximation, but it does not introduce significant error into engineering calculations.

CHAPTER 12. Phase Equilibrium: Introduction

12.2

THE PHASE RULE. DUHEM’S THEOREM

The phase rule for nonreacting systems, presented without proof in Sec. 3.1, results from the
application of a rule of algebra. Thus, the number of variables that may be independently fixed
in a system at equilibrium is the difference between the total number of variables that characterize the intensive state of the system and the number of independent equations that can be
written relating those variables.
The intensive state of a PVT system containing N chemical species and π phases in equilibrium is characterized by its temperature T, pressure P, and N − 1 mole fractions1 for each phase.
The number of these phase-rule variables is 2 + (N − 1)(π). The masses or amounts of the phases
are not phase-rule variables because they have no influence on the intensive state of the system.
As will become clear later in this chapter, an independent phase-equilibrium equation
may be written connecting intensive variables for each of the N species for each pair of phases
present. Thus, the number of independent phase-equilibrium equations is (π − 1)(N). The
difference between the number of phase-rule variables and the number of independent equations connecting them is the number of variables that may be independently fixed. Called the
degrees of freedom of the system F, the number is:
F = 2 + (N − 1)(π) − (π − 1)(N )
Upon reduction, this becomes the phase rule:
	​
​F = 2 − π + N​​	

(3.1)

Duhem’s theorem is another rule, similar to the phase rule, that applies to the extensive
state of a closed system at equilibrium. When both the extensive state and the intensive state
of the system are fixed, the state of the system is said to be completely determined, and it is
characterized not only by the 2 + (N − 1)π intensive phase-rule variables but also by the π
extensive variables represented by the masses (or mole numbers) of the phases. Thus the total
number of variables is:
	​
​2 + ​(​N − 1​)​π + π = 2 + Nπ​​	
For a closed system formed from specified amounts of the chemical species present,
a material-balance equation can be written for each of the N chemical species, providing N
more equations. These, in addition to the (π − 1)N phase-equilibrium equations, represent a
number of independent equations equal to:
	​
​(π − 1)​N + N = π N​	
The difference between the number of variables and the number of equations is therefore:
	​
2 + Nπ − π N = 2​	
On the basis of this result, Duhem’s theorem is stated as follows:
For any closed system formed from known amounts of prescribed chemical species, the equilibrium state is completely determined when any
two independent variables are fixed.
1Only N − 1 mole fractions are required, because Σ x = 1.

12.3. Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium: Qualitative Behavior

The two independent variables subject to specification may in general be either intensive or
extensive. However, the number of independent intensive variables is given by the phase rule.
Thus when F = 1, at least one of the two variables must be extensive, and when F = 0, both
must be extensive.

12.3

VAPOR/LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM: QUALITATIVE BEHAVIOR

Vapor/liquid equilibrium (VLE) is the state of coexistence of liquid and vapor phases. In this
qualitative discussion, we limit consideration to systems comprised of two chemical species
because systems of greater complexity cannot be adequately represented graphically.
For a system comprised of two chemical species (N = 2), the phase rule becomes
F = 4 − π. Because there must be at least one phase (π = 1), the maximum number of phaserule variables that must be specified to fix the intensive state of the system is three: P, T,
and one mole (or mass) fraction. All equilibrium states of the system can therefore be represented in three-dimensional P-T-composition space. Within this space, the states of pairs
of phases coexisting at equilibrium (F = 4 − 2 = 2) define surfaces. A schematic threedimensional diagram illustrating these surfaces for VLE is shown in Fig. 12.1.

liquid equilibrium.

424

CHAPTER 12. Phase Equilibrium: Introduction

This figure shows schematically the P-T-composition surfaces that contain the equilibrium states of saturated vapor and saturated liquid for species 1 and 2 of a binary system.
Here, species 1 is the “lighter” or more volatile species. The lower surface contains the
­saturated-vapor states; it is the P-T-y1 surface. The upper surface contains the saturated-liquid
states; it is the P-T-x1 surface. These surfaces intersect along the lines RKAC1 and UBHC2,
which represent the vapor pressure-vs.-T curves for pure species 1 and 2. Moreover, the lower
and upper surfaces form a continuous rounded surface across the top of the diagram between
C1 and C2 , the critical points of pure species 1 and 2; the critical points of the various mixtures
of the two species lie along a line on the rounded edge of the surface between C1 and C2. This
critical locus is defined by the points at which vapor and liquid phases in equilibrium become
identical. Because of this geometric feature of an open end (at low T and P) and three closed
edges formed by the critical locus and the pure component vapor pressure curves, the pair of
surfaces is often called the “phase envelope.” No stable single phase exists at points inside
the phase envelope. When T, P, and the overall composition correspond to a point inside the
envelope, separation into vapor and liquid phases occurs. These have compositions that fall on
the lower and upper surface, respectively, at the system T and P.
The subcooled-liquid region lies above the upper surface of Fig. 12.1; the superheated-­
vapor region lies below the lower surface. The interior space between the two surfaces is the
region of coexistence of both liquid and vapor phases. If one starts with a liquid at conditions represented by point F and reduces the pressure at constant temperature and composition
along vertical line FG, the first bubble of vapor appears at point L, which lies on the upper
surface. Thus, L is called a bubblepoint, and the upper surface is called the bubblepoint surface. The state of the vapor bubble in equilibrium with the liquid at L is represented by a point
on the lower surface at the temperature and pressure of L. This point is indicated by V. Line LV
is an example of a tie line, which connects points representing phases in equilibrium.
As the pressure is further reduced along line FG, more liquid vaporizes until at W the
process is complete. Thus W lies on the lower surface and represents a state of saturated
vapor having the mixture composition. Because W is the point at which the last drops of
liquid (dew) disappear, it is called a dewpoint, and the lower surface is called the dewpoint
surface. Continued reduction of pressure produces expansion of the vapor in the superheated
vapor region.
Because of the complexity of three-dimensional diagrams like Fig. 12.1, the detailed
characteristics of binary VLE are usually depicted by two-dimensional graphs that display what
is seen on various planes that cut the three-dimensional diagram. The three principal planes,
each perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, are illustrated in Fig. 12.1. Thus a vertical
plane perpendicular to the temperature axis is outlined as AEDBLA. The lines on this plane form
a P-x1-y1 phase diagram at constant T. If the lines from several such planes are projected on a
single parallel plane, a diagram like Fig. 12.2(a) is obtained. It shows P-x1-y1 plots for three
different temperatures. The one for Ta represents the section of Fig. 12.1 indicated by AEDBLA.
The horizontal lines are tie lines connecting the compositions of phases in equilibrium. The
temperatures Tb and Td lie between the two pure-species critical temperatures identified by
C1 and C2 in Fig. 12.1. The curves for these two temperatures therefore do not extend all the
way across the diagram. The mixture critical points are denoted by the letter C. Each is a tangent
point at which a horizontal line touches the curve. This is so because all tie lines connecting
phases in equilibrium are horizontal, and the tie line connecting identical phases (the definition
of a critical point) must therefore be the last such line to cut the diagram.

A horizontal plane passing through Fig. 12.1 perpendicular to the P axis is identified by KJIHLK. Viewed from above, the lines on this plane represent a T-x1-y1 diagram.
When lines for several pressures are projected on a parallel plane, the resulting diagram is
that shown in Fig. 12.2(b). This figure is analogous to Fig. 12.2(a), except that it represents
phase behavior for three constant pressures, Pa, Pb, and Pd. The one for Pa represents the
section of Fig. 12.1 indicated by KJIHLK. Pressure Pb lies between the critical pressures of
the two pure species at points C1 and C2. Pressure Pd is above the critical pressures of both
pure species; therefore, the T-x1-y1 diagram appears as an “island.” Similar P-x1-y1 behavior
[Fig. 12.2(a)] is unusual. Note that on the P-x1-y1 plot, the upper curve represents the saturated liquid and the lower curve represents the saturated vapor, but for the T-x1-y1, the
upper curve represents saturated vapor and the lower curve represents saturated liquid.
To avoid confusion, one must keep in mind the fact that vapors form at high T and low P.
Other possible plots include vapor mole fraction y1 vs. liquid mole fraction x1 for either
the constant-T conditions of Fig. 12.2(a) or the constant-P conditions of Fig. 12.2(b). Such plots
reduce the dimensionality of the representation further by representing the coexisting phases by
a single curve, with no information about T or P, rather than as a pair of curves bounding a
two-dimensional region. Thus, they convey less information than a T-x1-y1 or P-x1-y1 plot, but
are more convenient for rapidly relating phase compositions at a fixed T or P.
The third plane identified in Fig. 12.1, vertical and perpendicular to the composition
axis, passes through points SLMN and Q. When projected on a parallel plane, the lines from
several planes form a diagram such as that shown in Fig. 12.3. This is the PT diagram; lines
UC2 and RC1 are vapor-pressure curves for the pure species, identified by the same letters
as in Fig. 12.1. Each interior loop represents the PT behavior of saturated liquid and of
saturated vapor for a system of fixed overall composition. The different loops are for different

compositions. Clearly, the PT relation for saturated liquid is different from that for saturated
vapor of the same composition. This is in contrast to the behavior of a pure species, for
which the bubble and dew lines coincide. At points A and B in Fig. 12.3, saturated-liquid
and saturated-­vapor lines intersect. At such points a saturated liquid of one composition and
a saturated vapor of another composition have the same T and P, and the two phases are
therefore in equilibrium. The tie lines connecting the coinciding points at A and at B are
perpendicular to the PT plane, as illustrated by the tie line LV in Fig. 12.1.

Critical Points of Binary Mixtures and Retrograde Condensation
The critical point of a binary mixture occurs where the nose of a loop in Fig. 12.3 is tangent
to the envelope curve. Put another way, the envelope curve is the critical locus. One can verify
this by considering two closely adjacent loops and noting what happens to the point of intersection as their separation becomes infinitesimal. Figure 12.3 shows that the location of the
critical point on the nose of the loop varies with composition. For a pure species the critical
point is the highest temperature and highest pressure at which vapor and liquid phases can
coexist, but for a mixture it is in general neither. Therefore under certain conditions a condensation process occurs as the result of a reduction in pressure.
Consider the enlarged nose section of a single PT loop shown in Fig. 12.4. The critical
point is at C. The points of maximum pressure and maximum temperature are identified as
MP and MT , respectively. The interior dashed curves indicate the fraction of the overall system
that is liquid in a two-phase mixture of liquid and vapor. To the left of the critical point C a
reduction in pressure along a line such as BD is accompanied by vaporization of liquid from
bubblepoint to dewpoint, as would be expected. However, if the original condition corresponds
to point F, a state of saturated vapor, liquefaction occurs upon reduction of the pressure and
reaches a maximum at point G, after which vaporization takes place until the dewpoint is
reached at point H. This phenomenon is called retrograde condensation. It can be important in

427

12.3. Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium: Qualitative Behavior

the operation of deep natural-gas wells where the pressure and temperature in the underground
formation may be at conditions represented by point F. If the pressure at the wellhead is that
of point G, the product stream from the well is an equilibrium mixture of liquid and vapor.
Because the less-volatile species are concentrated in the liquid phase, significant separation
is accomplished. Within the underground formation itself, the pressure tends to drop as the
gas supply is depleted. If not prevented, this leads to the formation of a liquid phase and a
consequent reduction in the production of the well. Repressuring is therefore a common
practice; that is, lean gas (gas from which the less-volatile species have been removed) is
returned to the underground reservoir to maintain an elevated pressure.
A PT diagram for the ethane(1)/n-heptane(2) system is shown in Fig. 12.5, and a y1-x1
diagram for several pressures for the same system appears in Fig. 12.6. By convention, one
typically plots as y1 and x1 the mole fractions of the more volatile species in the mixture.
The maximum and minimum concentrations of the more volatile species obtainable by distillation at a given pressure are indicated by the points of intersection of the appropriate y1-x1
curve with the diagonal, for at these points the vapor and liquid have the same composition.
They are in fact mixture critical points, unless y1 = x1 = 0 or y1 = x1 = 1. Point A in Fig. 12.6
represents the composition of the vapor and liquid phases at the maximum pressure at which
the phases can coexist in the ethane/n-heptane system. The composition is about 77 mol-%
ethane and the pressure is about 87.1 bar. The corresponding point on Fig. 12.5 is labeled M.
A complete set of consistent phase diagrams for this system has been prepared by Barr-David.2

The PT diagram of Fig. 12.5 is typical for mixtures of nonpolar substances such as
hydrocarbons. A PT diagram for a very different kind of system, methanol(1)/benzene(2), is
shown in Fig. 12.7. The nature of the curves in this figure suggests how difficult it can be to
predict phase behavior for species so dissimilar as methanol and benzene, especially at conditions near the mixture critical point.

Low-Pressure Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium Examples
Although VLE in the critical region is of considerable importance in the petroleum and
natural-gas industries, most chemical processing is accomplished at much lower pressures.
Figures 12.8 and 12.9 display common types of Pxy and Txy behavior at conditions well
removed from the critical region.
Figure 12.8(a) shows data for tetrahydrofuran(1)/carbon tetrachloride(2) at 30°C.
When the liquid phase behaves as an ideal solution, as defined in Chapter 10, and the vapor
phase behaves as an ideal-gas-state mixture, then the system is said to follow Raoult’s law.
As discussed in Chapter 13, this is the simplest model of vapor/liquid equilibrium. For a
system that obeys Raoult’s law, the P-x1 or bubblepoint curve is a straight line connecting
the vapor pressures of the pure species. In Fig. 12.8(a), the bubblepoint curve lies below the
linear P-x1 relation characteristic of Raoult’s-law behavior. When such negative departures
from linearity become sufficiently large, relative to the difference between the two pure-species
vapor pressures, the P-x1 curve exhibits a minimum, as illustrated in Fig. 12.8(b) for the

chloroform(1)/tetrahydrofuran(2) system at 30°C. This figure shows that the P-y1 curve also
has a minimum at the same point. Thus at this point where x1 = y1 the dewpoint and bubblepoint curves are tangent to the same horizontal line. A boiling liquid of this composition
produces a vapor of exactly the same composition, and the liquid therefore does not change
in composition as it evaporates. No separation of such a constant-boiling solution is possible
by distillation. The term azeotrope is used to describe this state.3
The data for furan(1)/carbon tetrachloride(2) at 30°C shown by Fig. 12.8(c) provide an
example of a system for which the P-x1 curve lies above the linear P-x1 relation. The system
shown in Fig. 12.8(d) for ethanol(1)/toluene(2) at 65°C exhibits positive departures from linearity large enough to cause a maximum in the P-x1 curve. This state is a maximum-­pressure
azeotrope. Just as for the minimum-pressure azeotrope, the vapor and liquid phases in equilibrium have the identical composition.
Appreciable negative departures from P-x1 linearity reflect liquid-phase intermolecular
attractions that are stronger between unlike than between like pairs of molecules. Conversely,
appreciable positive departures result for solutions for which liquid-phase intermolecular interactions between like molecules are stronger than between unlike ones. In this latter case the forces
between like molecules may be so strong as to prevent complete miscibility, and the system then
forms two separate liquid phases over a range of compositions, as described later in this chapter.
Because distillation processes are carried out more nearly at constant pressure than at
constant temperature, T-x1-y1 diagrams of data at constant P are of great practical interest.
The four such diagrams corresponding to those of Fig. 12.8 are shown for atmospheric
pressure in Fig. 12.9. Note that the dewpoint (T-y1) curves lie above the bubblepoint

maximum-­temperature (or maximum-boiling) azeotrope on Fig. 12.9(b). An analogous
correspondence exists between Figs. 12.8(d) and 12.9(d). The y1-x1 diagrams at constant
P for the same four systems are shown in Fig. 12.10. The point at which a curve crosses
the diagonal line of the diagram represents an azeotrope, for at such a point y1 = x1. Such
yx diagrams are useful for qualitative analysis of distillation processes. The greater the
separation between the yx curve and the diagonal line, the easier the separation. Examination
of Fig. 12.10 immediately shows that complete separation of both tetrahydrofuran/carbon
tetrachloride mixtures and furan/carbon tetrachloride mixtures by distillation is possible,
and that the separation of the furan/carbon tetrachloride mixture will be much easier to
accomplish. Likewise, the diagram shows that the other two systems form azeotropes and
cannot be completely separated by distillation at this pressure.

Evaporation of a Binary Mixture at Constant Temperature
The P-x1-y1 diagram of Fig. 12.11 describes the behavior of acetonitrile(1)/nitromethane(2) at
75°C. The line labeled P-x1 represents states of saturated liquid; the subcooled-­liquid region
lies above this line. The curve labeled P-y1 represents states of saturated vapor; the superheated-­
vapor region lies below this curve. Points lying between the saturated-liquid and saturated-vapor
lines are in the two-phase region, where saturated liquid and saturated vapor coexist in
­equilibrium. The P-x1 and P-y1 lines meet at the edges of the diagram, where saturated liquid
and saturated vapor of the pure species coexist at the vapor pressures P​
​​ 1sat
​  ​​ and P
​​ ​2sat
​  ​​.
To illustrate the nature of phase behavior in this binary system, we follow the course of a
constant-temperature expansion process on the P-x1-y1 diagram. We imagine that a subcooled
liquid mixture of 60 mol-% acetonitrile and 40 mol-% nitromethane exists in a piston/cylinder
arrangement at 75°C. Its state is represented by point a in Fig. 12.11. Withdrawing the piston slowly enough reduces the pressure while maintaining the system at equilibrium at 75°C.

Because the system is closed, the overall composition remains constant during the process, and
the states of the system as a whole fall on the vertical line descending from point a. When the
pressure reaches the value at point b, the system is saturated liquid on the verge of v­ aporizing.
A minuscule further decrease in pressure produces a bubble of vapor, represented by
point b′. The two points b and b′ together represent the equilibrium state. Point b is a
­bubblepoint, and the P-x1 line is the locus of bubblepoints.
As the pressure is further reduced, the amount of vapor increases and the amount of
liquid decreases, with the states of the two phases following paths b′c and bc′, respectively.
The dotted line from point b to point c represents the overall states of the two-phase system.
Finally, as point c is approached, the liquid phase, represented by point c′, has almost disappeared, with only droplets (dew) remaining. Point c is therefore a dewpoint, and the P-y1
curve is the locus of dewpoints. Once the dew has evaporated, only saturated vapor at point c
remains, and further pressure reduction leads to superheated vapor at point d.
During this process, the volume of the system would first remain nearly constant in the
subcooled liquid region from point a to point b. From point b to point c, the volume would
increase dramatically, but not discontinuously. For a pure substance, the phase transition would
occur at a single pressure (the vapor pressure), but for a binary mixture it occurs over a range
of pressures. Finally, from point c to point d the volume would be approximately inversely
proportional to pressure. Similarly, the heat flow required to maintain constant temperature

434

CHAPTER 12. Phase Equilibrium: Introduction

during pressure reduction would be negligible in the subcooled liquid region and small in the
superheated vapor region, but would be substantial between points b and c, where the latent
heat of vaporization of the mixture must be supplied.

Evaporation of a Binary Mixture at Constant Pressure
Figure 12.12 is the T-x1-y1 diagram for the same system at a constant pressure of 70 kPa. The
T-y1 curve represents states of saturated vapor, with states of superheated vapor lying above
it. The T-x1 curve represents states of saturated liquid, with states of subcooled liquid lying
below it. The two-phase region lies between these curves.
With reference to Fig. 12.12, consider a constant-pressure heating process leading from a state of subcooled liquid at point a to a state of superheated vapor at point d.
The path shown on the figure is for a constant overall composition of 60 mol-% acetonitrile. The temperature of the liquid increases as a result of heating from point a to point b,
where the first bubble of vapor appears. Thus point b is a bubblepoint, and the T-x1 curve is
the locus of bubblepoints.
As the temperature is further increased, the amount of vapor increases and the amount
of liquid decreases, with the states of the two phases following paths b′c and bc′, respectively.
The dotted line from point b to point c represents the overall states of the two-phase system.

12.4. Equilibrium and Phase Stability

Finally, as point c is approached, the liquid phase, represented by point c′, has almost disappeared, with only droplets (dew) remaining. Point c is therefore a dewpoint, and the T-y1
curve is the locus of dewpoints. Once the dew has evaporated, only saturated vapor at point c
remains, and further heating leads to superheated vapor at point d.
The change in volume and the heat flows in this process would be similar to those for the
constant-temperature evaporation described previously, with a dramatic volume change as the
two-phase region is traversed. Above and below the two-phase region, the heat flow and temperature change would be related by the heat capacities of the vapor and liquid, respectively. Within
the two-phase region, the apparent heat capacity would be much higher, as it would include both
a sensible heat component, required to increase the temperature of both phases, and a larger
latent-heat component, required for transfer of material from the liquid to the vapor phase.

12.4

EQUILIBRIUM AND PHASE STABILITY

In the preceding discussion, we have assumed that a single liquid phase was present. Our everyday experience tells us that such an assumption is not always valid; oil-and-vinegar salad dressing
provides a prototypical example of its violation. In such cases, the Gibbs energy is lowered by the
liquid splitting into two separate phases, and the single phase is said to be unstable. In this section, we demonstrate that the equilibrium state of a closed system at fixed T and P is that which
minimizes the Gibbs energy, and we then apply this criterion to the problem of phase stability.
Consider a closed system containing an arbitrary number of species and comprised of
an arbitrary number of phases in which the temperature and pressure are spatially uniform
(though not necessarily constant in time). The system is initially in a nonequilibrium state
with respect to mass transfer between phases and chemical reaction. Changes that occur in the
system are necessarily irreversible, and they take the system ever closer to an equilibrium state.
We imagine that the system is placed in surroundings such that the system and surroundings
are always in thermal and mechanical equilibrium. Heat exchange and expansion work are then
accomplished reversibly. Under these circumstances the entropy change of the surroundings is:
dQsurr
dQ
dSsurr = _____
​​ 
 ​​ = − ____
​​   ​​
Tsurr
T
The final term applies to the system, for which the heat transfer dQ has a sign opposite to that
of dQsurr, and the temperature of the system T replaces Tsurr, because both must have the same
value for reversible heat transfer. The second law requires:
dS t + dSsurr ≥ 0
where S t is the total entropy of the system. Combination of these expressions yields, upon
rearrangement:
dQ ≤ TdS t
(12.1)
Application of the first law provides:
dU t = dQ + dW = dQ − PdV t
or

dQ = dU t + Pd V t

436

CHAPTER 12. Phase Equilibrium: Introduction

Combining this equation with Eq. (12.1) gives:
dU t + PdV t ≤ TdS t
or

dUt + PdVt − TdSt ≤ 0 (12.2)

Because this relation involves properties only, it must be satisfied for changes
in the state of any closed system of spatially uniform T and P, without restriction to the
conditions of reversibility assumed in its derivation. The inequality applies to every incremental change of the system between nonequilibrium states, and it dictates the direction of
change that leads toward equilibrium. The equality holds for changes between equilibrium
states (reversible processes).
Equation (12.2) is so general that application to practical problems is difficult; restricted
versions are much more useful. For example, by inspection:
(dU t​​)​  ​S​​  t​,V t​​​ ≤ 0
where the subscripts specify properties held constant. Similarly, for processes that occur at
constant U t and V t,
(dS t ​​)​  ​U​​  t​,​V​​  t​​​​ ≥ 0
An isolated system is necessarily constrained to constant internal energy and volume, and for
such a system it follows directly from the second law that the last equation is valid.
If a process is restricted to occur at constant T and P, then Eq. (12.2) may be written:
t
d​​U​T,
 ​​P​+ d(PV t )T, P − d(TSt )T, P ≤ 0

or

d (U t + PV t − T S t )T,P ≤ 0

From the definition of the Gibbs energy [Eq. (6.4)],
G t = H t − TS t = U t + PVt − TS t
Therefore,

(dG t)T, P ≤ 0 (12.3)

Of the possible specializations of Eq. (12.2), this is the most useful, because T and P, which
are easily measured and controlled, are more conveniently held constant than are other pairs of
variables, such as U t and V t.4
Equation (12.3) indicates that all irreversible processes occurring at constant T and
P proceed in such a direction as to cause a decrease in the Gibbs energy of the system.
Therefore:
The equilibrium state of a closed system is that state for which the total
Gibbs energy is a minimum with respect to all possible changes at the
given T and P.

4Although T and P are most easily held constant in experimental work, in molecular simulation studies, other pairs
of variables are often more easily held constant.

437

12.4. Equilibrium and Phase Stability

This criterion of equilibrium provides a general method for determination of equilibrium states.
One writes an expression for G t as a function of the numbers of moles (mole numbers) of the
species in the several phases and then finds the set of values for the mole numbers that minimizes
G t, subject to the constraints of mass and element conservation. This procedure can be applied
to problems of phase equilibrium, chemical-reaction equilibrium, or combined phase and chemical-reaction equilibrium, and it is most useful for complex equilibrium problems.
Equation (12.3) provides a criterion that must be satisfied by any single phase that is
stable with respect to the alternative that it split into two phases. It requires that the Gibbs
energy of an equilibrium state be the minimum value with respect to all possible changes at
the given T and P. Thus, for example, when mixing of two liquids occurs at constant T and P,
the total Gibbs energy must decrease, because the mixed state must be the one of lower Gibbs
energy with respect to the unmixed state. As a result:
G t ≡ nG < ​​∑​ ​​​ ni Gi   from which   G < ​​∑​ ​​​ xi Gi
i

i

G ​−​ ​​∑​ ​​​ xi Gi < 0

or

i

(const T, P )

According to the definition of Eq. (11.1), the quantity on the left is the Gibbs-energy change
of mixing. Therefore, ΔG < 0. Thus, as noted in Sec. 11.1, the Gibbs-energy change of mixing
must always be negative, and a plot of G vs. x1 for a binary system must appear as shown by
one of the curves of Fig. 12.13. With respect to curve II, however, there is a further consideration. If, when mixing occurs, a system can achieve a lower value of the Gibbs energy by
forming two phases than by forming a single phase, then the system splits into two phases.
This is in fact the situation represented between points α and β on curve II of Fig. 12.13 because
the straight dashed line connecting points α and β represents the overall values of G for the
β
range of states consisting of two phases of compositions ​​x​1α​  ​​ and ​​x​1​  ​​ in various proportions.
Thus the solid curve shown between points α and β cannot represent stable phases with respect
to phase splitting. The equilibrium states between α and β consist of two phases.

CHAPTER 12. Phase Equilibrium: Introduction

These considerations lead to the following criterion of stability for a single-phase binary
system for which ΔG ≡ G − x1G1 − x2G2:
At fixed temperature and pressure, a single-phase binary mixture is stable if and only if ΔG and its first and second derivatives are continuous

Liquid/Liquid Equilibrium
For conditions of constant pressure, or when pressure effects are negligible, binary liquid/
liquid (LLE) is conveniently displayed on a solubility diagram, a plot of T vs. x1. Figure 12.14
shows binary solubility diagrams of three types. The first, Fig. 12.14(a), shows curves (binodal
curves) that define an “island.” They represent the compositions of coexisting phases: curve
UAL for the α phase (rich in species 2), and curve UBL for the β phase (rich in species 1).
β
Equilibrium compositions ​​x​1α​  ​​ and ​​x​1​  ​​ at a particular T are defined by the intersections of a
horizontal tie line with the binodal curves. At each temperature, these compositions are those
for which the curvature of the ΔG vs. x1 curve changes sign. Between these compositions, it is
concave down (negative second derivative) and outside them it is concave up. At these points,
the curvature is zero; they are inflection points on the the ΔG vs. x1 curve. Temperature TL
is a lower consolute temperature, or lower critical solution temperature (LCST); temperature
TU is an upper consolute temperature, or upper critical solution temperature (UCST). At temperatures between TL and TU, LLE is possible; for T < TL and T > TU, a single liquid phase is
obtained for the full range of compositions. The consolute points are limiting states of twophase equilibrium for which all properties of the two equilibrium phases are identical.
Actually, the behavior shown on Fig. 12.14(a) is rarely observed; the LLE binodal
curves are often interrupted by curves for yet another phase transition. When they intersect the

curve, only an LCST exists [Fig. 12.14(c)]; when they intersect both, no consolute point exists,
and yet another behavior is observed.5

12.5

VAPOR/LIQUID/LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM

As noted in the previous section, the binodal curves representing LLE can intersect the
VLE bubblepoint curve. This gives rise to the phenomenon of vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium (VLLE). A binary system of two liquid phases and one vapor phase in equilibrium has
(by the phase rule) but one degree of freedom. For a given pressure, the temperature and the
compositions of all three phases are therefore fixed. On a temperature/composition diagram
the points representing the states of the three phases in equilibrium fall on a horizontal line
at T *. In Fig. 12.15, points C and D represent the two liquid phases, and point E represents
the vapor phase. If more of either species is added to a system whose overall composition
lies between points C and D, and if the three-phase equilibrium pressure is maintained, the
phase rule requires that the temperature and the compositions of the phases be unchanged.
However, the relative amounts of the phases adjust themselves to reflect the change in overall
composition of the system.
At temperatures above T * in Fig. 12.15, the system may be a single liquid phase, two
phases (liquid and vapor), or a single vapor phase, depending on the overall composition.
5A comprehensive treatment of LLE is given by J. M. Srensen, T. Magnussen, P. Rasmussen, and Aa. Fredenslund,

CHAPTER 12. Phase Equilibrium: Introduction

In region α the system is a single liquid, rich in species 2; in region β it is a single liquid, rich
in species 1. In region α − V, liquid and vapor are in equilibrium. The states of the individual
phases fall on lines AC and AE. In region β − V, liquid and vapor phases, described by lines
BD and BE, exist at equilibrium. Finally, in the region designated V, the system is a single
vapor phase. Below the three-phase temperature T *, the system is entirely liquid, with features
described in Sec. 12.4; this is the region of LLE.
When a vapor is cooled at constant pressure, it follows a path represented on Fig. 12.15
by a vertical line. Several such lines are shown. If one starts at point k, the vapor first reaches
its dewpoint at line BE and then its bubblepoint at line BD, where condensation into single
liquid phase β is complete. This is the same process that takes place when the species are completely miscible. If one starts at point n, no condensation of the vapor occurs until temperature
T * is reached. Then condensation occurs entirely at this temperature, producing the two liquid
phases represented by points C and D. If one starts at an intermediate point m, the process is
a combination of the two just described. After the dewpoint is reached, the vapor, tracing a
path along line BE, is in equilibrium with a liquid tracing a path along line BD. However, at
temperature T* the vapor phase is at point E. All remaining condensation therefore occurs at
this temperature, producing the two liquids of points C and D.
Figure 12.15 is drawn for a single constant pressure; equilibrium phase compositions,
and hence the locations of the lines, change with pressure, but the general nature of the diagram is the same over a range of pressures. For most systems the species become more soluble
in one another as the temperature increases, as indicated by lines CG and DH of Fig. 12.15.
If this diagram is drawn for successively higher pressures, the corresponding three-phase
­equilibrium temperatures increase, and lines CG and DH extend further and further until they
meet at the liquid/liquid consolute point M, as shown by Fig. 12.16.
As the pressure increases, line CD becomes shorter and shorter (indicated in Fig. 12.16
by lines C′D′ and C″D″), until at point M it diminishes to a differential length. For still higher
pressures (P4) the temperature is above the critical-solution temperature, and there is but
a single liquid phase. The diagram then represents two-phase VLE, and it has the form of
Fig. 12.9(d), exhibiting a minimum-boiling azeotrope.

For an intermediate range of pressures, the vapor phase in equilibrium with the two
liquid phases has a composition that does not lie between the compositions of the two liquids.
This is illustrated in Fig. 12.16 by the curves for P3, which terminate at A″ and B″. The vapor
in equilibrium with the two liquids at C″ and D″ is at point F. In addition the system exhibits
an azeotrope, as indicated at point J.
Not all systems behave as described in the preceding paragraphs. Sometimes the upper
critical-solution temperature is never attained because a vapor/liquid critical temperature is
reached first. In other cases the liquid solubilities decrease with an increase in temperature.
In this event a lower critical-solution temperature exists, unless solid phases appear first.
There are also systems that exhibit both upper and lower critical-solution temperatures.6
Figure 12.17 is the phase diagram drawn at constant T corresponding to the
constant-P diagram of Fig. 12.15. On it we identify the three-phase-equilibrium pressure
as P*, the three-phase-equilibrium vapor composition as y​
​​1∗​  ​​, and the compositions of the
β
two liquid phases that contribute to the vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium state as ​​x​1α​  ​​ and ​​x​1​  ​​.
The phase boundaries separating the three liquid-phase regions are solubilities.
Although no two liquids are totally immiscible, this condition is so closely approached
in some instances that the assumption of complete immiscibility does not lead to appreciable
error for many engineering purposes. The phase characteristics of an immiscible system are
illustrated by the temperature/composition diagram of Fig. 12.18(a). This diagram is a special
case of Fig. 12.15 wherein phase α is pure species 2 and phase β is pure species 1. Thus lines
ACG and BDH of Fig. 12.15 become in Fig. 12.18(a) vertical lines at x1 = 0 and x1 = 1.
In region I, vapor phases with compositions represented by line BE are in equilibrium
with pure liquid species 1. Similarly, in region II, vapor phases whose compositions lie along
line AE are in equilibrium with pure liquid species 2. Liquid/liquid equilibrium exists in region
III, where the two phases are pure liquids of species 1 and 2. If one cools a vapor mixture
starting at point m, the constant-composition path is represented by the vertical line shown
in the figure. At the dewpoint, where this line crosses line BE, pure liquid species 1 begins
to condense. Further reduction in temperature toward T * causes continued condensation of

Here, the remaining vapor condenses at temperature T *, producing two liquid phases, one of

SYNOPSIS

After studying this chapter, including the end-of-chapter problems, one should be able to:
∙ Understand that equilibrium implies absence of driving forces for net changes in the
macroscopic state of a system
∙ State and apply the phase rule and Duhem’s theorem for nonreacting systems

Thermodynamic Formulations
for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

The objective of this chapter is to apply the framework of solution thermodynamics developed in Chapter 10 to the specific situation of vapor/liquid equilibrium (VLE), as introduced
qualitatively in Chapter 12. Because of the practical importance of distillation as a means of
separating and purifying chemical species, VLE is the most studied type of phase equilibrium.
Approaches developed for analyzing VLE also provide the foundation for most analyses of
liquid/liquid equilibrium (LLE), vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium (VLLE), and combined phase
and reaction equilibrium, as considered in Chapter 15.
The analysis of VLE problems in the present chapter begins by developing a general
formulation of such problems in terms of vapor-phase fugacity coefficients and liquid-phase
activity coefficients. For VLE at low pressure, where the gas phase approaches the ideal-gas state,
simplified versions of this formulation are applicable. For those conditions, activity coefficients can
be obtained directly from experimental VLE data. These can then be fit to mathematical models.
Finally, the models can be used to predict activity coefficients and VLE behavior for situations
where experiments have not been performed. Thus, the analyses presented in this chapter allow
for the efficient correlation and generalization of the observed behavior of real physical systems.
Specifically, in this chapter, we will:
∙ Define activity coefficients and relate them to the excess Gibbs energy of a mixture
∙ Formulate the general criterion for phase equilibrium in terms of vapor-phase fugacity
coefficients and liquid-phase activity coefficients (the gamma/phi formulation of VLE)
∙ Show how this general formulation simplifies to Raoult’s law or a modified version of
Raoult’s law under appropriate conditions
∙ Perform bubblepoint, dewpoint, and flash calculations using Raoult’s law and modified
versions thereof
∙ Illustrate the extraction of activity coefficients and excess Gibbs energy from experimental low-pressure VLE data
∙ Address the issue of thermodynamic consistency of experimentally derived activity
coefficients
450

13.1. Excess Gibbs Energy and Activity Coefficients

451

∙ Introduce several excess Gibbs energy and activity coefficient models and the fitting of
model parameters to experimental VLE data
∙ Perform VLE calculations under conditions where the complete gamma/phi formulation
is required
∙ Show that residual properties and excess properties can also be evaluated from cubic
equations of state
∙ Demonstrate the formulation and solution of VLE problems using cubic equations of state
The foundation for VLE calculations was laid in Chapter 10, where Eq. (10.39) was
shown to apply for the equilibrium of pure species:
	​​f​  iv​  ​= ​f​  i​ l​= ​f​  isat
​  ​​

(10.39)

and Eq. (10.48) was shown to apply to the equilibrium of species in mixtures:
	​​​​fˆ​​  ​​ iv​  ​= ​​fˆ​​  ​​ il​  ​

​  (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​​	

(10.48)

We recall also the definitions of fugacity coefficients, as given by Eqs. (10.34) and (10.52).
From the latter we can write for the fugacity coefficient of species i in a vapor phase:
	​​​f​​ ˆ ​​ iv​  ​= ​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​​y​i​P​	

(13.1)

An analogous equation can be written for the liquid phase, but this phase is often treated differently.

13.1

EXCESS GIBBS ENERGY AND ACTIVITY COEFFICIENTS

In view of Eq. (10.8), G
​​​ ¯ ​​  i​​ = ​μ​i​, Eq. (10.46) may be written as:
​​​ ¯ ​​  i​​ = ​Γ​i​(T ) + RT ln ​​fˆ​​  ​​ i​​​
G
For an ideal solution, in accord with Eq. (10.83), this becomes:
	​​​G¯ ​​iid​  ​= ​Γ​i​(T ) + RT ln ​x​i​​fi​​​
By difference,
​​fˆ​​  ​​ i​​
	​​​G¯ ​​  i​​ − ​​G¯ ​​iid​  ​= RT ln ___
​   ​​
​x​i​​fi​​
Equation (10.88), written for the partial Gibbs energy, shows that the left side of this equation
is the partial excess Gibbs energy G
​​​ ¯ ​​iE​  ​​; the dimensionless ratio f​​ ​​​ˆ ​​ i​​ ∕ ​x​i​​fi​​appearing on the right is
the activity coefficient of species i in solution, symbol γi. Thus, by definition,
​fˆ​i​
	​
​γ​i​≡ _
​ ​
(13.2)
​x​i​​fi​​
Whence,	​​​​G¯ ​​iE​  ​= RT ln ​γ​i​​​

(13.3)

452

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

These equations establish a thermodynamic foundation for activity coefficients.

of restricted forms, which are written by inspection:

Equations (13.5) through (13.7) are analogs of Eqs. (10.57) through (10.59) for residual
­properties. Whereas the fundamental residual-property relation derives its usefulness from its
direct relation to experimental PVT data and equations of state, the fundamental excess-property
relation is useful because VE, HE, and γi are all experimentally accessible. Activity coefficients
are found from vapor/liquid equilibrium data, as discussed in Sec. 13.5, while VE and HE
values come from mixing experiments, as discussed in Chap. 11.
Equation (13.7) demonstrates that ln γi is a partial property with respect to GE∕RT. It
is the analog of Eq. (10.59), which shows the same relation of ln ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​ to GR∕RT. The partial-­
property analogs of Eqs. (13.5) and (13.6) are:

These equations allow the calculation of the effect of pressure and temperature on the activity

The following forms of the summability and Gibbs/Duhem equations result from the
fact that ln γi is a partial property with respect to GE∕RT:

Just as the fundamental property relation of Eq. (10.54) provides complete property
information from a canonical equation of state expressing G∕RT as a function of T, P, and
composition, so the fundamental residual-property relation, Eq. (10.55) or (10.56), provides

453

13.2. The Gamma/Phi Formulation of VLE

complete residual-property information from a PVT equation of state, from PVT data, or from
generalized PVT correlations. However, obtaining complete property information requires,
in addition to PVT data, the ideal-gas-state heat capacities of the species that comprise the
system. In complete analogy, the fundamental excess-property relation, Eq. (13.4), provides
complete excess-property information, given an equation for GE∕RT as a function of its
canonical variables, T, P, and composition. However, this formulation represents less-complete
property information than does the residual-property formulation, because it tells us nothing
about the properties of the pure constituent chemical species.

13.2

THE GAMMA/PHI FORMULATION OF VLE

Rearranging Eq. (13.2), the definition of the activity coefficient, and writing it for species i in
the liquid phase gives:
	​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​= ​x​i​​γ​il​  ​​f​  i​ l​​
Substitution in Eq. (10.48) for f​​ ​​​ˆ ​​ il​  ​​by this equation and for ​f​​ˆ​​ iv​  ​​by Eq. (13.1) yields:
	​
​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​P = ​x​i​​γ​il​  ​​f​  i​ l​
​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​

(13.12)

Transformation of Eq. (13.12) into a working formulation requires the development of suitable
expressions for ​​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​​, ​​γ​il​  ​​, and ​​f​  i​ l​​. Eliminating the pure-species property ​​f​  i​ l​​by Eq. (10.44) proves
helpful:

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

The gamma/phi formulation of VLE appears in several variations, depending on the
treatment of Φi and γi.
Applications of thermodynamics to vapor/liquid equilibrium calculations encompass the
goals of finding the temperature, pressure, and compositions of phases in equilibrium. Indeed,
thermodynamics provides the mathematical framework for the systematic correlation, extension, generalization, evaluation, and interpretation of such data. Moreover, it is the means by
which the predictions of various theories of molecular physics and statistical mechanics may
be applied to practical purposes. None of this can be accomplished without models for the
behavior of systems in vapor/liquid equilibrium. The two simplest models, already considered,
are the ideal-gas state for the vapor phase and the ideal-solution model for the liquid phase.
These are combined in the simplest treatment of vapor/liquid equilibrium in what is known as
Raoult’s law. It is by no means a “law” in the universal sense of the First and Second Laws of
Thermodynamics, but it does become valid in a rational limit.

13.3 SIMPLIFICATIONS: RAOULT’S LAW, MODIFIED RAOULT’S
LAW, AND HENRY’S LAW
Figure 13.1 shows a vessel in which a vapor mixture and a liquid solution coexist in vapor/liquid
equilibrium. If the vapor phase is assumed to be in its ideal-gas state and the liquid phase is
assumed to be an ideal solution, both Φi and γi in Eq. (13.13) approach unity, and this equation
reduces to its simplest possible form, Raoult’s law:1
	​​​y​i​P = ​x​i​​P​isat
​  ​

(i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​​

(13.16)

where xi is a liquid-phase mole fraction, yi is a vapor-phase mole fraction, and P​
​​ isat
​  ​​is the vapor
pressure of pure species i at the temperature of the system. The product yiP is the partial pressure of species i in the vapor phase. Note that the only thermodynamic function to survive here
is the vapor pressure of pure-species i, suggesting its primary importance in VLE calculations.

Figure 13.1: Schematic representation of VLE. The temperature T and
pressure P are uniform throughout the vessel and can be measured
with appropriate instruments. Vapor and liquid ­samples may be

The ideal-gas-state assumption means that Raoult’s law is limited in application to low to
moderate pressures. The ideal-solution assumption implies that Raoult’s law can have approximate validity only when the species that comprise the system are chemically similar. Just as
the ideal-gas state serves as a standard to which real-gas behavior may be compared, the ideal
solution represents a standard to which real-solution behavior may be compared. ­Liquid-phase
ideal-solution behavior is promoted when the molecular species are not too different in size
and have the same chemical nature. Thus, a mixture of isomers, such as ortho-, meta-, and
para-xylene, conforms very closely to ideal-solution behavior. So do mixtures of adjacent
members of a homologous series, as for example, n-hexane/n-heptane, ethanol/propanol,
and benzene/toluene. Other examples are acetone/acetonitrile and acetonitrile/nitromethane.
Figures 12.11 and 12.12 for the latter system are constructed to represent Raoult’s law.
The simple model of VLE represented by Eq. (13.16) provides a realistic description of
actual behavior for a relatively small class of systems. Nevertheless, it serves as a standard of
comparison for more complex systems. A limitation of Raoult’s law is that it can be applied
only to species of known vapor pressure, and this requires each species to be “subcritical,” i.e.,
at a temperature below its critical temperature. Raoult’s law cannot be applied to situations for
which the temperature exceeds the critical temperature of one or more species in the mixture.

Dewpoint and Bubblepoint Calculations with Raoult’s Law
Although VLE problems with other combinations of variables are possible, engineering interest
centers on dewpoint and bubblepoint calculations, of which there are four types:
BUBL P: Calculate {​y​i​} and P, given {​x​i​} and T
DEW P:   Calculate {​x​i​} and P, given {​y​i​} and T
	​
​    ​ ​​
BUBL T: Calculate {​y​i​} and T, given {​x​i​} and P
DEW T:    Calculate {​x​i​} and T ​, given {y​i​} and P
In each case the name indicates the quantities to be calculated: either a BUBL (vapor) or a
DEW (liquid) composition and either P or T. Thus, one must specify either the vapor-phase
or the liquid-phase composition and either P or T, thus fixing 1 + (N − 1) or N intensive
­variables, exactly the number of degrees of freedom F required by the phase rule [Eq. (3.1)]
for vapor/liquid equilibrium.
Because ​∑​i​​y​i​= 1​, Eq. (13.16) may be summed over all species to yield:
	​
P = ​∑​ ​x​i​​P​isat
​  ​​(13.17)
i

This equation finds direct application in bubblepoint calculations, where the vapor-phase
composition is unknown. For a binary system with x2 = 1 − x1,
	​
P = ​P​2sat
​  ​ + (​P​1sat
​  ​ − ​P​2sat
​  ​) ​x​1​(13.18)
and a plot of P vs. x1 at constant temperature is a straight line connecting ​​P​2sat
​  ​​ at x1 = 0 with​​
P​1sat
​  ​​ at x1 = 1. The Pxy diagram of Fig. 12.11 for acetonitrile(l)/nitromethane(2) shows this
linear relation.
For this system at a temperature of 75°C, the pure-species vapor pressures are​​
P​1sat
​  ​ = 83.21 kPa​ and ​​P​2sat
​  ​ = 41.98 kPa​. BUBL P calculations are readily carried out by

substitution of these values in Eq. (13.18), along with values of x1. The results allow calculation of the P-x1 relation. The corresponding values of y1 are found from Eq. (13.16):

When P is fixed, the temperature varies along with x1 and y1, and the temperature range
is bounded by saturation temperatures t​
​​1sat
​  ​​ and ​​t​2sat
​  ​​, the temperatures at which the pure species
exert vapor pressures equal to P. These temperatures can be calculated from Antoine equation:
​B​i​
	​​t​isat
​  ​ = _______
​
​− ​C​i​​
​Ai​​− ln P
Figure 12.12 for acetonitrile(l)/nitromethane(2) at P = 70 kPa shows these values as​​
t​1sat
​  ​ = 69.84° C​ and t​​ ​2sat
​  ​ = 89.58° C​.
The construction of Fig. 12.12 for this system is based on BUBL T calculations, which
are less direct than BUBL P calculations. One cannot solve directly for the temperature because
it is buried in the vapor-pressure equations. An iterative or trial-and-error approach is needed
in this case. For a binary system and a given value of x1, Eq. (13.18) must give the specified
pressure when the vapor pressures are evaluated at the correct temperature. The most intuitive
procedure is simply to make calculations at trial values of T until the correct value of P is generated. The goal is the known value for P in Eq. (13.18), and it is found by varying T. Working
out a convenient strategy for homing in on the correct final answer using a hand calculator is
not difficult. Microsoft Excel’s Goal Seek function also does the job quite effectively when
varying a single T to find a desired value of P. The Solver function allows this to be done
simultaneously for many compositions.2

Modified Raoult’s Law
Raoult’s law results when both γi and Φi are set equal to unity in Eq. 13.13. For low to moderate pressures the latter substitution is usually reasonable. However, modifying Raoult’s law
to properly evaluate the activity coefficient γi, and thus take into account liquid-phase deviations from ideal solution behavior, produces a much more reasonable and broadly applicable
description of VLE behavior:
	​​​y​i​P = ​x​i​​γ​i​​P​isat
​  ​

(i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​​

This equation provides for entirely satisfactory representation of the VLE behavior of a great
variety of systems at low to moderate pressures.
Because ​∑​i​​y​i​= 1​, Eq. (13.19) may be summed over all species to yield:
	​
P = ​∑​ ​​x​i​​γ​i​​P​isat

Bubblepoint and dewpoint calculations made with the modified Raoult’s law are only a bit
more complex than the same calculations made with Raoult’s law. In particular, bubblepoint
pressure calculations are straightforward because the specified liquid composition allows
immediate evaluation of the activity coefficients. Dewpoint pressure calculations require an
iterative solution process because the unknown liquid-phase composition is required to evaluate the activity coefficients. Bubblepoint and dewpoint temperature calculations are further
complicated by the temperature dependence of the activity coefficients, along with the temperature dependence of the vapor pressures, but the same iterative or trial-and-error approaches
used with Raoult’s law calculations can still be employed.

Example 13.1
For the system methanol(1)/methyl acetate(2), the following equations provide a reasonable correlation for the activity coefficients:
	​​ln ​γ​1​= A​x​22​  ​  ​  ln ​γ​2​= A​x​12​  ​​ 

where​ 

A = 2.771 − 0.00523T​​

In addition, the following Antoine equations provide vapor pressures:

T − 53.424

where T is in kelvins and the vapor pressures are in kPa. Assuming the validity of
Eq. (13.19), calculate:
(a) P and { yi} for T = 318.15 K and x1 = 0.25.
(b) P and {xi} for T = 318.15 K and y1 = 0.60.
(c) T and { yi} for P = 101.33 kPa and x1 = 0.85.
(d) T and {xi} for P = 101.33 kPa and y1 = 0.40.
(e) The azeotropic pressure and the azeotropic composition for T = 318.15 K.

Solution 13.1
In the dewpoint and bubblepoint calculations of parts (a) through (d), the key is the
dependence of the activity coefficients on T and x1. In (a), both values are given,

458

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium
and solution is direct. In (b) only T is given, and solution is by trial with x1 varied to
reproduce the given value of y1. In (c) only x1 is given, and T is varied to reproduce
the given value of P. In (d) neither T nor x1 is given, and both are varied alternately,
T to yield P and x1 to yield y1. In parts (b) through (d), the trial and error calculations
are readily automated using Microsoft Excel’s Goal Seek function.
(a) A BUBL P calculation. For T = 318.15 K, the Antoine equations yield ​​
P​1sat
​  ​ = 44.51​ and P
​​ ​2sat
​  ​ = 65.64 kPa.​The activity-coefficient correlation ­provides
A = 1.107, γ1 = 1.864, and γ2 = 1.072. By Eq. (13.20), P = 73.50 kPa and by
Eq. (13.19), y1 = 0.282.
(b) A DEW P calculation. With T unchanged from part (a), P
​​ ​1sat
​  ​​, 	​​P​2sat
​  ​​, and A are
also unchanged. The unknown liquid-phase composition is varied in trial calculations that evaluate the activity coefficients, P by Eq. (13.21), and y1 by
Eq. (13.19), with the goal of reproducing the given value y1 = 0.6. This leads
to final values:
​P = 62.59 kPa​   ​x​1​= 0.8169​   ​γ​1​= 1.0378​ ​

γ​2​= 2.0935​​

(c) A BUBL T calculation. Solution by trial here varies T until the given value of
P is reproduced. A reasonable starting value for T is found from the saturation
temperatures of the pure species at the known pressure. The Antoine equation,
solved for T, becomes:
​B​i​
	​​T​isat
​  ​ = _______
​

​Ai​​− ln P
		

Application for P = 101.33 kPa leads to: T​
​​ 1sat
​  ​ = 337.71​ and T
​​ ​2sat
​  ​ = 330.08 K​.
An average of these values serves as an initial T: Each trial value of T leads
immediately to values for the activity coefficients and to a value for P by
Eq. (13.20). The known value of P = 101.33 kPa is reproduced when:

T = 331.20 K   ​

​  ​ = 77.99 kPa ​

(d) A DEW T calculation. Because P = 101.33 kPa, the saturation temperatures
are the same as those of part (c), and an average value again serves as an
initial value for T. Because the liquid-phase composition is not known, the
activity coefficients are initialized as γ1 = γ2 = 1. Trial calculations alternately
vary T to reproduce the given value of P and then x1 to reproduce the known
value of y1. The process yields the following final values:

(e) First determine whether or not an azeotrope exists at the given temperature. This
calculation is facilitated by the definition of a quantity called the relative volatility:

​y​2​∕ ​x​2​

(13.23)

The correlating equations for the activity coefficients show that when x1 = 0,
γ2 = 1 and γ1 = exp(A); when x1 = 1, γ1 = 1 and γ2 = exp(A). Therefore, in
these limits,

​P​sat

Values of ​​P​1sat
​  ​​, P
​​ ​2sat
​  ​​, and A are given in part (a) for the temperature of interest. The
limiting values of α12 are therefore (α12)​​x​1​​​= 0 = 2.052 and (α12)​​x​1​​​ = 1 = 0.224. The
value at one limit is greater than 1, whereas the value at the other limit is less than
1. Thus, an azeotrope does exist, because α12 is a continuous function of x1 and
must pass through the value of 1.0 at some intermediate composition.

		

For the azeotrope, α12 = 1, and Eq. (13.23) becomes:

​γ​1az​  ​ ____

The difference between the correlating equations for ln γ1 and ln γ2 provides
the general relation:

​γ​2​

		

Thus the azeotrope occurs at the value of x1 for which this equation is satisfied
when the activity-coefficient ratio has its azeotrope value of 1.4747, i.e., when
​γ​1​
	​
ln ​__​= ln 1.4747 = 0.388​
​γ​2​

		

Solution gives ​​x​1az​  ​ = 0.325​. For this value of x1, ​​γ​1az​  ​ = 1.657​. With ​​x​1az​  ​ = ​y​1az​  ​​,
Eq. (13.19) becomes:

	​
​P​az​= ​γ​1az​  ​​P​1sat

Thus,	​​​P​az​= 73.76 kPa

ultimately correlations for them are based on experiment. Thus, examination of a set of

The criterion for vapor/liquid equilibrium is that the fugacity of species i is the same
in both phases. If the vapor phase is in its ideal-gas state, then the fugacity equals the partial
pressure, and
	​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​= ​fˆ​​ iv​  ​= ​y​i​P​
The liquid-phase fugacity of species i increases from zero at infinite dilution (xi = yi → 0) to​​
P​isat
​  ​​for pure species i. This is illustrated by the data of Table 13.1 for the methyl ethyl ketone(l)/
toluene(2) system at 50°C.3 The first three columns list experimental P-x1-y1 data, and columns
4 and 5 show ​f​​ˆ​​ 1l ​​  = ​y​1​P​ and ​​​fˆ​​ 2l ​​  = ​y​2​P​. The fugacities are plotted in Fig. 13.2 as solid lines. The
straight dashed lines represent Eq. (10.83), the Lewis/Randall rule, which expresses the composition dependence of the constituent fugacities in an ideal solution:
	​​​fˆ​​ iid​  ​= ​x​i​​f​  i​ l​​

(10.83)

Although derived from a particular set of data, Fig. 13.2 illustrates the general nature of
the ​​​fˆ​​ 1l ​​​  and ​​​fˆ​​ 2l ​​​  vs. x1 relationships for a binary liquid solution at constant T. The equilibrium pressure P varies with composition, but its influence on the liquid-phase values of ​f​​ˆ​​ 1l ​​​  and ​​​fˆ​​ 2l ​​​  is
negligible. Thus a plot at constant T and P would look the same, as indicated in Fig. 13.3 for
species i (i = 1, 2) in a binary solution at constant T and P.

The lower dashed line in Fig. 13.3, representing the Lewis/Randall rule, is c­ haracteristic
of ideal-solution behavior. It provides the simplest possible model for the composition
­dependence of ​f​​ ˆ​​ il​  ​​, representing a standard to which actual behavior may be compared. Indeed,
the activity coefficient as defined by Eq. (13.2) formalizes this comparison:

	​
​γ​i​≡ ____

​x​  i​​ ​f​  i​  ​ ​​fˆ​​  ​​ i​  ​
Thus the activity coefficient of a species in solution is the ratio of its actual fugacity to the value
given by the Lewis/Randall rule at the same T, P, and composition. For the calculation of experimental values of γi, both ​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​​ and ​f​​ ˆ​​ iid​  ​​are eliminated in favor of measurable quantities.

This is a restatement of Eq. (13.19), the modified Raoult’s law, and is adequate for present
­purposes, allowing easy calculation of activity coefficients from experimental low-pressure

that the ln γi generally have the same sign as GE. That is, positive GE implies activity
­coefficients greater than unity and negative GE implies activity coefficients less than unity, at
least over most of the composition range.

Henry’s Law
The solid lines in both Figs. 13.2 and 13.3, representing experimental values of ​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​​, become
tangent to the Lewis/Randall-rule lines at xi = 1. This is a consequence of the Gibbs/Duhem
equation, as will be shown presently. In the other limit, xi → 0, ​f​​ˆ​​ il​  ​​becomes zero. Thus, the
ratio ​f​​ ˆ​​ il​  ​∕ ​x​i​is indeterminate in this limit, and application of l’Hôpital’s rule yields:

Equation (13.25) defines Henry’s constant i as the limiting slope of the ​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​​-vs.-xi curve at
xi = 0. As shown by Fig. 13.3, this is the slope of a line drawn tangent to the curve at xi = 0.
The equation of this tangent line expresses Henry’s law.
	​​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​= ​x​i​​ ​i​​​

(13.26)

Applicable in the limit as xi → 0, it is also of approximate validity for small values of xi.
For a system of air in equilibrium with liquid water, the mole fraction of water vapor in
the air is found from Raoult’s law applied to the water with the assumption that the water is
essentially pure. Thus, Raoult’s law for the water (species 2) becomes ​y​2​P = ​P​2sat

atmospheric pressure, this equation yields:

law, applied here for a pressure low enough that the vapor phase is in its ideal-gas state. Values
of i come from experiment, and Table 13.2 lists values at 25°C for a few gases dissolved in
water. For the air/water system at 25°C and atmospheric pressure, Henry’s Law applied to air

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

Example 13.2
Assuming that carbonated water contains only CO2(1) and H2O(2), determine
the ­compositions of the vapor and liquid phases in a sealed can of “soda” at 25°C
if the pressure inside the can is 5 bar.

Solution 13.2
Expecting that the liquid phase will be nearly pure water and the vapor phase will
be nearly pure CO2, we apply Henry’s law for CO2 (species 1) and Raoult’s law
for water (species 2):
	​​​y​1​P = ​x​1​​ ​1​

​  ​y​2​P = ​x​2​​P​2sat

With the vapor phase nearly pure CO2, we obtain the liquid-phase CO2 mole

From the steam tables, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is 3.166 kPa, or
0.0317 bar. Thus, y2 = 0.0317/5 = 0.0063. Consistent with our expectations, the
liquid is 99.7% water and the vapor is 99.4% CO2.

Henry’s law is related to the Lewis/Randall rule through the Gibbs/Duhem equation, expressed
by Eq. (10.14). Written for a binary liquid solution with M
​​​ ¯ ​​  i​​​ replaced by G
​​​ ¯ ​​il​  ​= ​μ​il​  ​​, it becomes:
	​​​x​1​d​μ​1l ​​  + ​x​2​d​μ​2l ​​  = 0

​  (const T, P)​​

Differentiation of Eq. (10.46) at constant T and P yields: d​ ​μ​il​  ​= RTd ln ​fˆ​​ il​  ​​. The preceding equation is then
	​​​x​1​d ln ​​fˆ​​ 1l ​​  + ​x​2​d ln ​​fˆ​​ 2l ​​  = 0

(13.28)

This equation is the exact expression of the Lewis/Randall rule as applied to real solutions.
It also implies that Eq. (10.83) provides approximately correct values of ​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​​ when xi ≈ 1:
​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​≈ ​fˆ​​ iid​  ​= ​x​i​​f​  i​ l​​.
Henry’s law applies to a species as it approaches infinite dilution in a
binary solution, and the Gibbs/Duhem equation insures validity of the
Lewis/Randall rule for the other species as it approaches purity.
The fugacity shown by Fig. 13.3 is for a species with positive deviations from ideality
in the sense of the Lewis/Randall rule. Negative deviations are less common but are also
observed; the ​​​fˆ​​ il​  ​​ -vs.-xi curve then lies below the Lewis/Randall line. In Fig. 13.5 the fugacity
of acetone is shown as a function of composition for two different binary liquid solutions at
50°C. When the second species is methanol, acetone exhibits positive deviations from ideality. When the second species is chloroform, the deviations are negative. The fugacity of pure
acetone facetone is of course the same regardless of the identity of the second species. However,
Henry’s constants, represented by slopes of the two dotted lines, are very different for the
two cases.

Example 13.3
A fog consists of spherical water droplets with a radius of about 10−6 m. Because of
surface tension, the internal pressure within a water droplet is greater than the external pressure. For droplet radius r and surface tension σ, the internal pressure in a water

droplet is greater than the external pressure by δP = 2σ∕r. This increases the fugacity
of the water in a droplet above that of bulk water at the same conditions. Thus, it tends
to cause the fog to evaporate. However, the fugacity increase may be countered by a
decrease in temperature or by the dissolution of atmospheric pollutants. To stabilize
the fog with respect to bulk water at the same temperature, determine:
(a) The minimum temperature decrease required.
(b) The minimum concentration of atmospheric pollutants required in the fog
droplets.

Solution 13.3
(a) At 25°C the surface tension of pure water is 0.0694 N·m−1, and

​ 
 ​ = 0.1338 × ​10​​6​Pa​  or​  1.388 bar​​
	​​δP = __________

Two general equations apply to the isothermal change in Gibbs energy ­resulting
from a change in pressure. The first results from differentiation of Eq. (10.31),
the defining equation for fugacity, and the second from restriction of Eq. (6.11)
to constant temperature:

	​​d ​G​i​= RTd ln ​fi​​​  ​​(const T )​​​ 

and ​  d ​G​i​= ​V​i​dP​  ​​(const T )​​​​

In combination these equations yield:

Because the molar volume of water is virtually unaffected by pressure,
integration gives:

This is the amount by which the fugacity of water in a fog droplet exceeds the
fugacity of bulk water at the same temperature. Thus the fog is not stable, and
it dissipates by evaporation. However, a sufficient decrease in temperature of
the fog reduces droplet fugacity enough to stabilize the fog.
		  An equation giving the effect of temperature on fugacity is developed from
Eq. (10.31) by subtracting from it the ideal-gas-state form of the same equation (for which fi = P). Thus

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

		

For a small temperature difference, δ ln ​f​​​H​2​O​ ≈ 0.0595 δT​. To find the δT
that counters the pressure-induced fugacity increase in a water droplet, we
set this fugacity difference equal to −0.00101, the negative of the fugacity
increase. Thus
​0.0595 δT = − 0.00101​

		

and ​ δT = − 0.017 K​

This is the minimum temperature decrease of the fog required for stability
with respect to bulk water.

(b) The fugacity of water in fog droplets is also lowered by the dissolution of
impurities, such as atmospheric pollutants. The droplets then become solutions
with water as the major constituent, and their fugacity is ​fˆ​​H​2​O​. Because the
mole fraction of water is near unity, the Lewis/Randall rule provides an excellent approximation, ​fˆ​​H​2​O​= ​f​​H​2​O​​x​​H​2​O​.​The fugacity change of the water resulting from the dissolution of impurities is then:
	​​δ ​f​​H​2​O​= ​fˆ​​H​2​O​− ​f​​H​2​O​= ​f​​H​2​O​​x​​H​2​O​− ​f​​H​2​O​= ​f​​H​2​O​(​x​​H​2​O​− 1)​ = − ​f​​H​2​O​​x​impurity​​​

This quantity is again the negative of the increase caused by surface tension.

		Thus,

and impurities of only 0.1% stabilize the fog with respect to bulk water.

13.4 CORRELATIONS FOR LIQUID-PHASE ACTIVITY
COEFFICIENTS
Liquid-phase activity coefficients γi play a vital role in the gamma/phi formulation of
VLE. They are directly related to the excess Gibbs energy. In general, GE∕RT is a function
of T, P, and composition, but for liquids at low to moderate pressures it is a very weak
function of P. Therefore its pressure dependence is usually neglected, and for applications at
constant T, excess Gibbs energy is treated as a function of composition alone:

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

When all parameters are zero, ln γ1 = 0, ln γ2 = 0, γ1 = γ2 = 1. These are the values for
an ideal solution, and they represent a limiting case where the excess Gibbs energy is zero.
If all parameters except A0 are zero, Y = A0, and Eqs. (13.32) and (13.33) reduce to:
​ln ​γ​1​= ​A​0​​x​22​  ​​

​ln ​γ​2​= ​A​0​​x​12​  ​​

(13.37)

(13.38)

The symmetrical nature of these relations is evident. Infinite-dilution values of the activity
coefficients are ln γ​

Most widely found is the two-parameter truncation:

Y = ​A​0​+ ​A​1​(​x​1​− ​x​2​) = ​A​0​+ ​A​1​(2 ​x​1​− 1)​
in which Y is linear in x1. An alternate form of this equation results from the definitions A0 + A1 =
A21 and A0 − A1 = A12. Eliminating parameters A0 and A1 in favor of A21 and A12, we obtain:

The Redlich/Kister expansion and the van Laar equations are special cases of a general
treatment based on rational functions, i.e., on equations for GE∕(x1x2RT ) given by ratios of
polynomials.7 They provide great flexibility in the fitting of VLE data for binary systems.
However, they have scant theoretical foundation, and therefore they fail to provide a rational
basis for extension to multicomponent systems. Moreover, they do not incorporate an explicit
temperature dependence of their parameters, though this can be supplied on an ad hoc basis.

Local-Composition Models
Theoretical developments in the molecular thermodynamics of liquid-solution behavior are often
based on the concept of local composition. Within a liquid solution, local compositions, different
from the overall mixture composition, are presumed to account for the short-range order and
nonrandom molecular orientations that result from differences in molecular size and intermolecular forces. The concept was introduced by G. M. Wilson in 1964 with the publication of a
model of solution behavior since known as the Wilson equation.8 The success of this equation
in the correlation of VLE data prompted the development of alternative local-composition models, most notably the NRTL (Non-Random-Two-Liquid) equation of Renon and Prausnitz9 and
the UNIQUAC (UNIversal QUAsi-Chemical) equation of Abrams and Prausnitz.10 A further
significant development, based on the UNIQUAC equation, is the UNIFAC method,11 in which
activity coefficients are calculated from contributions of the various groups making up the molecules of a solution.
Wilson Equation. Like the Margules and van Laar equations, the Wilson equation contains just two parameters for a binary system (Λ12 and Λ21). It is written:

Multicomponent Systems
The local-composition models have limited flexibility in the fitting of data, but they are adequate
for most engineering purposes. Moreover, they are implicitly generalizable to multicomponent
systems without the introduction of any parameters beyond those required to describe the
constituent binary systems. For example, the Wilson equation for multicomponent systems is:

where Λij = 1 for i = j, etc. All indices refer to the same species, and summations are over all
species. For each ij pair there are two parameters, because Λij ≠ Λji. For a ternary system the
three ij pairs are associated with the parameters Λ12, Λ21; Λ13, Λ31; and Λ23, Λ32,
The temperature dependence of the parameters is given by:

where Vj and Vi are the molar volumes at temperature T of pure liquids j and i, and aij is a
constant independent of composition and temperature. Thus the Wilson equation, like all other
local-composition models, has built into it an approximate temperature dependence for the
parameters. Moreover, all parameters are found from data for binary (in contrast to multicomponent) systems. This makes parameter determination for the local-composition models a task
of manageable proportions.

FITTING ACTIVITY COEFFICIENT MODELS TO VLE DATA

In Table 13.3 the first three columns repeat the P-x1-y1 data of Table 13.1 for the system
methyl ethyl ketone(l)/toluene(2). These data points are also shown as circles on Fig. 13.6(a).
Values of ln γ1 and ln γ2 are listed in columns 4 and 5, and are shown by the open squares and
triangles of Fig. 13.6(b). They are combined for a binary system in accord with Eq. (13.10):
​G​E​
_
	​
​ ​= ​x​1​ln ​γ​1​+ ​x​2​ln ​γ​2​
RT

(13.54)

The values of GE∕RT so calculated are then divided by x1x2 to provide values of GE∕(x1x2 RT );
the two sets of numbers are listed in columns 6 and 7 of Table 13.3 and appear as solid circles
on Fig. 13.6(b).
The four thermodynamic functions ln γ1, ln γ2, GE∕RT, and GE∕(x1x2RT ), are properties
of the liquid phase. Figure 13.6(b) shows how their experimental values vary with composition for a particular binary system at a specified temperature. This figure is characteristic of
systems for which:
and
	​
​γ​i​≥ 1​
​ ln ​γ​i​  ≥  0​ (i = 1, 2)​​
In such cases the liquid phase shows positive deviations from Raoult’s-law behavior. This
is seen also in Fig. 13.6(a), where the P-x1 data points all lie above the dashed straight line,
which represents Raoult’s law.
Because the activity coefficient of a species in solution becomes unity as the species
becomes pure, each ln γi (i = 1, 2) tends to zero as xi → 1. This is evident in Fig. 13.6(b). At
the other limit, where xi → 0 and species i becomes infinitely dilute, ln γi approaches a finite
limit, namely, ln ​​γ​i∞
​  ​​. In the limit as x1 → 0, the dimensionless excess Gibbs energy GE∕RT as
given by Eq. (13.54) becomes:

The same result is obtained for x2 → 0 (x1 → 1). The value of GE∕RT (and GE) is therefore zero at both x1 = 0 and x1 = 1.
The quantity GE∕(x1x2RT ) becomes indeterminate both at x1 = 0 and x1 = 1, because GE
is zero in both limits, as is the product x1x2. For x1 → 0, l’Hôpital’s rule yields:

The minus sign preceding the last term comes from dx2∕dx1 = −1, a consequence of the

divided by dx1 to give:

Thus the limiting values of GE∕(x1x2RT ) are equal to the infinite-dilution limits of ln γ1 and ln
γ2. This result is illustrated in Fig. 13.6(b).
These results depend on Eq. (13.11), which is valid for constant T and P. Although the
data of Table 13.3 are for constant T, but variable P, negligible error is introduced through
Eq. (13.11) because liquid-phase activity coefficients are very nearly independent of P for
systems at low to moderate pressures.
Equation (13.11) has further influence on the nature of Fig. 13.6(b). Rewritten as,

it requires the slope of the ln γ1 curve to be everywhere of opposite sign to the slope of the
ln γ2 curve. Furthermore, when x2 → 0 (and x1 → 1), the slope of the ln γ1 curve is zero.
Similarly, when x1 → 0, the slope of the ln γ2 curve is zero. Thus, each ln γi (i = 1, 2) curve
terminates at zero with zero slope at xi = 1.

Data Reduction
Of the sets of points shown in Fig. 13.6(b), those for GE∕(x1x2RT ) most closely conform to
a simple mathematical relation. Thus a straight line provides a reasonable approximation to
this set of points, and mathematical expression is given to this linear relation by the equation:

where A21 and A12 are constants in any particular application. This is the Margules equation
as given by Eq. (13.39), with corresponding expressions for the activity coefficients given by
Eqs. (13.40) and (13.41).
For the methyl ethyl ketone/toluene system considered here, the curves of Fig. 13.6(b)
for GE∕RT, ln γ1, and ln γ2 represent Eqs. (13.39), (13.40), and (13.41) with:
and  ​ ​A​21​= 0.198​​
	​
​A​12​= 0.372​
These are values of the intercepts at x1 = 0 and x1 = 1 of the straight line drawn to represent
the GE∕(x1x2RT ) data points.
A set of VLE data has here been reduced to a simple mathematical equation for the
dimensionless excess Gibbs energy:

This equation concisely stores the information of the data set. Indeed, the Margules e­ quations
for ln γ1 and ln γ2 allow construction of a correlation of the original P-x1-y1 data set.
Equation (13.19) is written for species 1 and 2 of a binary system as:
	​​​y​1​P = ​x​1​​γ​1​​P​1sat
​  ​​  and​  ​y​2​P = ​x​2​​γ​2​​P​2sat

Values of γ1 and γ2 from Eqs. (13.40) and (13.41) with A12 and A21 as determined for
the methyl ethyl ketone(l)/toluene(2) system are combined with the experimental values
of ​​P​1sat
​  ​​ and ​​P​2sat
​  ​​ to calculate P and y1 by Eqs. (13.57) and (13.58) at various values of x1.
The results are shown by the solid lines of Fig. 13.6(a), which represent the calculated
P-x1 and P-y1 ­relations. They clearly provide an adequate correlation of the experimental
data points.
A second set of P-x1-y1 data, for chloroform(1)/1,4-dioxane(2) at 50°C,12 is given in
Table 13.4, along with values of pertinent thermodynamic functions. Figures 13.7(a) and
13.7(b) display all of the experimental values as points. This system shows negative deviations
from Raoult’s-law behavior; γ1 and γ2 are less than unity, and values of ln γ1, ln γ2, GE∕RT, and
GE∕(x1x2RT ) are negative. Moreover, the P-x1 data points in Fig. 13.7(a) all lie below the
dashed line representing Raoult’s-law behavior. Again the data points for GE∕(x1x2RT ) are
reasonably well correlated by the Margules equation, in this case with parameters:

and (13.58) provide the curves shown for these quantities in Figs. 13.7(a) and 13.7(b). Again,
the experimental P-x1-y1 data are adequately correlated. Although the correlations provided by

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

the Margules equations for the two sets of VLE data presented here are satisfactory, they are
not perfect. The two possible reasons are, first, that the Margules equations are not precisely
suited to the data set; second, that the P-x1-y1 data themselves are systematically in error such
that they do not conform to the requirements of the Gibbs/Duhem equation.
We have presumed in applying the Margules equations that the deviations of the
experimental points for GE∕(x1x2RT ) from the straight lines drawn to represent them result
from random error in the data. Indeed, the straight lines do provide excellent correlations
of all but a few data points. Only toward edges of a diagram are there significant deviations,
and these have been discounted because the error bounds widen rapidly as the edges of
such a diagram are approached. In the limits as x1 → 0 and x1 → 1, GE∕(x1x2RT ) becomes
indeterminate; experimentally this means that the values are subject to unlimited error and
are not measurable. However, the possibility exists that the correlation would be improved
were the GE∕(x1x2RT ) points represented by an appropriate curve, rather than a straight line.
Finding the correlation that best represents the data is a trial procedure.

Thermodynamic Consistency
The Gibbs/Duhem equation, Eq. (13.55), imposes a constraint on activity coefficients
that may not be satisfied by a set of experimental values derived from P-x1-y1 data. The
experimental values of ln γ1 and ln γ2 combine by Eq. (13.54) to give values of GE∕RT.
This addition process is independent of the Gibbs/Duhem equation. On the other hand, the
Gibbs/Duhem equation is implicit in Eq. (13.7), and activity coefficients derived from this
equation necessarily obey the Gibbs/Duhem equation. These derived activity coefficients
cannot possibly be consistent with the experimental values unless the experimental
values also satisfy the Gibbs/Duhem equation. Nor can a P-x1-y1 correlation calculated by
Eqs. (13.57) and (13.58) be consistent with such experimental values. If the experimental
data are inconsistent with the Gibbs/Duhem equation, they are necessarily incorrect as the
result of systematic error in the data. Because correlating equations for GE∕RT impose
consistency on derived activity coefficients, no correlation exists that can precisely
reproduce P-x1-y1 data that are inconsistent.
Our purpose now is to develop a simple test for the consistency with respect to the
Gibbs/Duhem equation of a P-x1-y1 data set. Equation (13.54) is written with experimental
values, calculated by Eq. (13.24), and denoted by an asterisk:

The right side of this equation is exactly the quantity that Eq. (13.55),
the Gibbs/Duhem equation, requires to be zero for consistent data. The
residual on the left therefore provides a direct measure of deviation from
the Gibbs/Duhem equation. The extent to which a data set departs from
consistency is measured by the degree to which these residuals fail to
scatter about zero.13

Example 13.4
VLE data for diethyl ketone(1)/n-hexane(2) at 65°C as reported by Maripuri and
­Ratcliff14 are given in the first three columns of Table 13.5. Reduce this set of data.

Solution 13.4
The last three columns of Table 13.5 present the experimental values, ln ​​γ​1*​  ​​, ln γ​​ ​2*​  ​​,
and (GE∕(x1x2RT ))*, calculated from the data by Eqs. (13.24) and (13.54). All
­values are shown as points on Figs. 13.8(a) and 13.8(b). The object here is to find
an equation for GE∕RT that provides a suitable correlation of the data. Although

This is the Margules equation with A21 = 0.70 and A12 = 1.35. Derived values of
ln γ1 and ln γ2 are calculated by Eqs. (13.40) and Eqs. (13.41), and derived values
of P and y1 all come from Eqs. (13.57) and (13.58). These results, plotted as solid
lines of Figs. 13.8(a) and 13.8(b), clearly do not represent a good correlation of
the data.
The difficulty is that the data are not consistent with the Gibbs/Duhem equation. That is, the sets of experimental values, ln 	​​γ​1*​  ​​ and ln ​​γ​2*​  ​,​shown in Table 13.5
are not in accord with Eq. (13.55). However, the values of ln γ1 and ln γ2 derived from
the correlation necessarily obey this equation; the experimental and derived values therefore cannot possibly agree, and the resulting correlation cannot provide a
precise representation of the complete set of P-x1-y1 data.
Application of the test for consistency represented by Eq. (13.59) requires calculation of the residuals δ(GE∕RT ) and δ ln(γ1∕γ2), values of which are plotted vs.
x1 in Fig. 13.9. The residuals δ(GE∕RT ) distribute themselves about zero,15 as is
required by the test, but the residuals δ ln(γ1∕γ2), which show the extent to which
the data fail to satisfy the Gibbs/Duhem equation, clearly do not. Average absolute
values of this residual less than 0.03 indicate data of a high degree of consistency;
average absolute values of less than 0.10 are probably acceptable. The data set
15The simple procedure used here to find a correlation for GE/RT would be slightly improved by a regression
­procedure that determines the values of A21 and A12 that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals δ(GE/RT ) .

the values of y1 are usually most suspect.
The method just described produces a correlation that is unnecessarily divergent from the experimental values. An alternative is to process just the P-x1 data;
this is possible because the P-x1-y1 data set includes more information than necessary. The procedure requires a computer but in principle is simple enough. Assuming that the Margules equation is appropriate to the data, one merely searches for
values of the parameters A12 and A21 that yield pressures by Eq. (13.57) that are as
close as possible to the measured values. The method is applicable regardless of
the correlating equation assumed and is known as Barker’s method.16 Applied to
the present data set, it yields the parameters:
	​
​A​21​= 0.596​ and​ ​A​12​= 1.153​​
Use of these parameters in Eqs. (13.39), (13.40), (13.41), (13.57), and (13.58) produces the results described by the dashed lines of Figs. 13.8(a) and 13.8(b). The
correlation cannot be precise, but it clearly provides a better overall representation
of the experimental P-x1-y1 data. Note, however, that it necessarily provides a

worse fit to the experimentally derived ln γ1, ln γ2, and (GE∕(x1x2RT )). This fitting
procedure ignores the vapor-phase composition data from which those experimentally derived activity coefficients were determined.

Incorporation of Vapor-Phase Fugacity Coefficients
Restriction to low pressures where the vapor phase can be assumed to be in the ideal-gas state
is not always possible or even desirable. Practical processes are often operated at elevated
pressure to increase throughput or capacity. In that case, experimental data may be taken at
elevated pressure to increase their relevance to process conditions.
At moderate pressures Eq. (3.36), the two-term virial expansion in P, is usually adequate
for property calculations. The fugacity coefficients required in Eq. (13.14) are then given by
Eq. (10.64), here written:

where	​
with δii = 0, δjj = 0, etc., and δij = δji, etc. Values of the virial coefficients come from a generalized correlation, as represented for example by Eqs. (10.69) through (10.74). The fugacity
coefficient for pure i as a saturated vapor ​​ϕ​isat

The inclusion of Φ1 and Φ2 evaluated by Eqs. (13.63) and (13.64) in the reduction of a set of
moderate-pressure VLE data is straightforward, because in this situation the values of T, P,
and y1 at each data point are known. After evaluating Φi, at each data point, the activity coefficients are calculated from:
​y​i​​Φ​i​P
	​
​γ​i​= ______
​ 
 ​​
​x​i​​P​isat
​  ​

(13.65)

These experimentally derived activity coefficients are then combined via Eq. (13.54), and
fitting to an excess Gibbs energy model proceeds as usual.
On the other hand, inclusion of the vapor-phase fugacity coefficients introduces significant
new complications to bubblepoint calculations and flash calculations because in those cases the
vapor-phase composition is unknown. When vapor-phase fugacity coefficients were not included,
bubblepoint pressure calculations could be made directly, without requiring any iterative solution
procedure. However, with the inclusion of the vapor-phase fugacity coefficients, all types of
bubblepoint, dewpoint, and flash calculations require iterative solution.

Extrapolation of Data to Higher Temperatures
A vast store of liquid-phase excess-property data for binary systems at temperatures near 30°C
and somewhat higher is available in the literature. Effective use of these data to extend GE
correlations to higher temperatures is critical to employing them for engineering design calculations. The key relations for the temperature dependence of excess properties are Eq. (10.89),

where

This general equation makes use of excess Gibbs-energy data at temperature T0, excess
enthalpy (heat-of-mixing) data at T1, and excess heat-capacity data at T2.
Evaluation of integral J requires information with respect to the temperature dependence
of C
​​ ​PE​  ​​. Because of the relative paucity of excess-heat-capacity data, the usual assumption is
that this property is constant, independent of T. In this event, integral J is zero, and the closer
T0 and T1 are to T, the less the influence of this assumption. When no information is available
with respect to C​
​​ PE​  ​​, and excess enthalpy data are available at only a single temperature, the
excess heat capacity must be assumed to be zero. In this case only the first two terms on the
right side of Eq. (13.68) are retained, and it more rapidly becomes imprecise as T increases.
Because the parameters of two-parameter correlations of GE data are directly related
to infinite-dilution values of the activity coefficients, our primary interest in Eq. (13.68) is
its application to binary systems at infinite dilution of one of the constituent species. For this
purpose, we divide Eq. (13.68) by the product x1x2. For C​

Data for the ethanol(1)/water(2) binary system provide a specific illustration. At a base temperature T0 of 363.15 K (90°C), the VLE data of Pemberton and Mash17 yield accurate values
for infinite-dilution activity coefficients:

infinite-dilution values of 	​​C​PE​  ​∕ ​(​x​1​​x​2​R)​, which are nearly constant and equal to

Barr-David and Dodge.19 Pemberton and Mash report pure-species vapor pressures at 90°C
for both ethanol and water, but the data of Barr-David and Dodge (at 150 and 200°C) do not

vapor-pressure data for the pure species and on mixture data at lower temperatures. The quality
of prediction is indicated by the P-x-y diagram of Fig. 13.13, which reflects the uncertainty of
the data as well.

RESIDUAL PROPERTIES BY CUBIC EQUATIONS OF STATE

In Sec. 6.3 we treated the calculation of residual properties by the virial equations of state, as
well as from generalized correlations, but we did not extend the treatment to cubic equations
of state at that time. The key differentiating feature of cubic equations of state is their ability to
treat both vapor and liquid phase properties. This capability is most valuable in the context of
VLE calculations, as considered in the present chapter. Thus, in this section we first treat the
computation of residual properties from cubic equations of state and then, in Sec. 13.7, show
how these can be used to carry out phase equilibrium calculations.
Results of some generality follow from the generic cubic equation of state:

a​(​T )​
	​
P = _____
​
​− ​_____________
  ​
V − b ​(​V + εb​)​(​V + σb​)​

(3.41)

Equations (6.58) through (6.60) are compatible with pressure-explicit equations of state.
We need only recast Eq. (3.41) to yield Z with density ρ as the independent variable. We
therefore divide Eq. (3.41) by ρRT and substitute V = 1∕ρ. With q given by Eq. (3.47),
q ≡ a(T )∕bRT, the result after algebraic reduction is:

The two quantities needed for evaluation of the integrals in Eqs. (6.58) through (6.60), Z − 1
and (∂Z∕∂T )​ρ,​ are readily obtained from this equation:

VLE FROM CUBIC EQUATIONS OF STATE

As shown in Sec. 10.6, phases at the same T and P are in equilibrium when the fugacity of
each species is the same in all phases. For VLE, this requirement is written:
	​​​fˆ​​ iv​  ​= ​fˆ​​ il​  ​   (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​

(10.48)

An alternative form results from the introduction of the fugacity coefficient, defined by Eq. (10.52):
	​
​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​P = ​x​i​​​ϕˆ​​il​  ​P​
or	​​​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​= ​x​i​​​ϕˆ​​il​  ​   (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​ ​

(13.77)

Applications of this equation with fugacity coefficients evaluated using cubic equations of
state are presented in the following subsections.

Vapor Pressures for a Pure Species
Although vapor pressures for a pure species ​​P​isat
​  ​​are subject to experimental measurement,
they are also implicit in a cubic equation of state. Indeed, the simplest application of cubic
equations of state for VLE calculations is to find the vapor pressure of a pure species at given
temperature T.
The subcritical PV isotherm of Fig. 3.9 labeled T2 < Tc is reproduced here as
Fig. 13.11. Generated by a cubic equation of state, it consists of three segments. The very steep
segment on the left (rs) is characteristic of liquids; in the limit as P → ∞, the molar volume V

491

13.7. VLE from Cubic Equations of State

approaches the constant b [Eq. 3.41]. The segment on the right (tu) with gentle downward
slope is characteristic of vapors; in the limit as P → 0 molar volume V approaches infinity.
The middle segment (st), containing both a minimum (note here that P < 0) and a maximum,
provides a smooth transition from liquid to vapor, but has no physical meaning. The actual
transition from liquid to vapor occurs at the vapor pressure along a horizontal line like that
which connects points M and W.

For pure species i, Eq. (13.77) reduces to Eq. (10.41), ​​ϕ​iv​  ​= ​ϕ​il​  ​​, which may be written:
	​
ln ​ϕ​il​  ​− ln ​ϕ​iv​  ​= 0​

(13.78)

The fugacity coefficient of a pure liquid or vapor is a function of its temperature and pressure.
For a saturated liquid or vapor, the equilibrium pressure is ​​P​isat
​  ​​, and Eq. (13.78) implicitly
expresses the functional relation,
	​​g(T, ​P​isat
​  ​) = 0​ 

  or

  ​  P
​ ​isat
​  ​ = f (T )​​

An isotherm generated by a cubic equation of state, as represented in Fig. 13.11, has
three volume roots for a specified pressure between P = 0 and P = P′. The smallest root lies
on the left line segment and is a liquid-like volume, e.g., at point M. The largest root lies on the
right line segment and is a vapor-like volume, e.g., at point W.
If these points lie at the vapor pressure, then M represents saturated
liquid, W represents saturated vapor, and they exist in phase equilibrium.
The root lying on the middle line segment has no physical significance.
Two widely used cubic equations of state, developed specifically for VLE calculations,
are the Soave/Redlich/Kwong (SRK) equation21 and the Peng/Robinson (PR) equation.22
Both are special cases of the generic cubic equation of state, Eq. (3.41). Equation-of-state

​(​​Z​  iv​  ​+ ε ​βi​​)​(​​Z​iv​  ​+ σ ​βi​​)​

(13.83)

For pure species i as a liquid, Eq. (3.49) is written:
1 + ​βi​​− ​Zi​l​  ​
	​​Z​il​  ​= ​βi​​+ ​(​Z​il​  ​+ ε ​βi​​)​​(​Z​il​  ​+ σ ​βi​​)​​ __________

​ )

(13.84)

The pure numbers ε, σ, Ψ, and Ω and expressions for α(Tri) are specific to the equation of state
and are given in Table 3.1 for several prototypical cubic equations of state.
In Sec. 13.6 and Sec. 10.5, we developed the following two relationships:
​G​  iR​  ​
	​​ ___ ​ = ​Z​i​− 1 − ln​(​Z​i​− ​βi​​)​− ​q​i​​I​i​​	
RT

(13.74)

​G​  iR​  ​
	​​ ___ ​ = ln ​ϕi​​
RT

(10.33)

Together these yield:	​ln ​ϕi​​= ​Z​i​− 1 − ln (​Z​i​− ​βi​​) − ​q​i​​I​i​

(13.85)

Values for ln ϕi are therefore implied by the equation of state. In Eq. (13.85), qi is given
by Eq. (13.82) and Ii by Eq. (13.72). For given T and P, the vapor-phase value, ​​Z​  iv​  ​​at point W
of Fig. 13.11, is given by Eq. (13.83), and the liquid-phase value Z​
​​ il​  ​​at point M, by Eq. (13.84).
v
l
Values for ​ln ​​ϕ​  i​  ​​and ​ln ​​ϕi​​  ​​are then found by Eq. (13.85). When they satisfy Eq. (13.77), then
P is the vapor pressure ​​P​isat
​  ​​ at temperature T, and M and W represent the states of saturated
liquid and vapor implied by the equation of state. Solution may be by trial, by iteration, or by
an appropriate nonlinear algebraic equation solution algorithm. The eight equations and eight
unknowns are listed in Table 13.8.
The calculation of pure-species vapor pressures as just described may be reversed to
allow evaluation of an equation-of-state parameter from a known vapor pressure P​
​​ isat
​  ​​ at temperature T. Thus, Eq. (13.85) may be written for each phase of pure-species i and combined in
accord with Eq. (13.77). Solving the resulting expression for qi yields:

This equation yields ​​I​  iv​  ​​ with ​​Z​  iv​  ​​from Eq. (13.83), and ​​I​il​  ​​ with ​​Z​il​  ​​from Eq. (13.79). However,
the equations for Z​ 
​​ iv​  ​​ and ​​Z​il​  ​​ contain qi, the quantity sought. Thus, a solution procedure is
required that yields values for eight unknowns given eight equations. An initial value of qi is
provided by the generalized correlation of Eqs. (13.79), (13.80), and (13.82).

Mixture VLE
The fundamental assumption when an equation of state is written for mixtures is that
it has exactly the same form as when written for pure species. Thus for mixtures,
Eqs. (13.83) and (13.84), written without subscripts, become:

​a​p​
​q​p​≡ _____

​b​ ​RT

The complication is that mixture parameters ap and bp, and therefore βp and qp, are functions
of composition. Systems in vapor/liquid equilibrium consist in general of two phases with
different compositions. The PV isotherms generated by an equation of state for these two
fixed compositions are represented in Fig. 13.12 by two similar lines: the solid line for the
liquid-phase composition and the dashed line for the vapor-phase composition. They are displaced from one another because the equation-of-state parameters are different for the two
compositions. However, each line includes three segments as described in connection with
the isotherm of Fig. 13.11. Thus, we distinguish between the composition that characterizes
a complete line and the phases, all of the same composition, that are associated with the segments of an isotherm.

P

compositions. The solid line is for a
liquid-phase composition; the dashed
line is for a vapor-phase composition.
Point B represents a bubblepoint with
the liquid-phase composition; point D
represents a dewpoint with the vaporphase composition. When these points
lie at the same P (as shown) they
­represent phases in equilibrium.

B

D
V

Each line contains a bubblepoint on its left segment representing saturated liquid and a
dewpoint of the same composition on its right segment representing saturated vapor23.
Because these points for a given line are for the same composition, they do not represent
phases in equilibrium and do not lie at the same pressure. (See Fig. 12.3, where for a given
constant-composition loop and a given T, saturated liquid and saturated vapor are at different
pressures.)
For a BUBL P calculation, the temperature and liquid composition are known, and this
fixes the location of the PV isotherm for the composition of the liquid phase (solid line).
The BUBL P calculation then finds the composition for a second (dashed) line that contains a dewpoint D on its vapor segment that lies at the pressure of the bubblepoint B on
the liquid segment of the solid line. This pressure is then the phase-equilibrium pressure,
23Note that bubblepoint B and dewpoint D in Fig. 13.12 are on different lines.

495

13.7. VLE from Cubic Equations of State

and the composition for the dashed line is that of the equilibrium vapor. This equilibrium
condition is shown by Fig. 13.12, where bubblepoint B and dewpoint D lie at the same P on
isotherms for the same T but representing the different compositions of liquid and vapor in
equilibrium.
Because no established theory prescribes the form of the composition dependence of
the equation-of-state parameters, empirical mixing rules have been proposed to relate mixture
parameters to pure-species parameters. The simplest realistic expressions are a linear mixing
rule for parameter b and a quadratic mixing rule for parameter a:
​b = ​∑​ ​​x​i​​bi​​
i

(13.91)

​a = ​∑​ ​​∑​ ​​x​i​​x​j​​a​ij​ (13.92)
i

j

with aij = aji. The general mole-fraction variable xi is used here because these mixing
rules are applied to both liquid and vapor mixtures. The aij are of two types: pure-species
­parameters (repeated subscripts, e.g., a11) and interaction parameters (unlike subscripts, e.g.,
a12). ­Parameter bi is for pure species i. The interaction parameters aij are often evaluated from
pure-species parameters by combining rules, e.g., a geometric-mean rule:
	​
​a​ij​= ​(​a​i​​a​j​)​1/2​

(13.93)

These equations, known as van der Waals prescriptions, provide for the evaluation of mixture
parameters solely from parameters for the pure constituent species. Although they are satisfactory only for mixtures comprised of simple and chemically similar molecules, they allow
straightforward calculations that illustrate how complex VLE problems can be solved.
Also useful for application of equations of state to mixtures are partial equation-of-state
parameters, defined by:

Because equation-of-state parameters are, at most, functions of temperature and composition, these definitions are in accord with Eq. (10.7). They are general equations, valid regardless of the particular mixing or combining rules adopted for the composition dependence of
mixture parameters.
Values of ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​il​  ​​ and ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​iv​  ​​are implicit in an equation of state, and with Eq. (13.77) they allow
calculation of mixture VLE. The same basic principle applies as for pure-species VLE, but
the calculations are more complex. With ϕ
​​​ˆ​​il​  ​​a function of T, P, and {xi}, and ​​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​​a function
of T, P, and {yi}, Eq. (13.72) represents N relations among the 2N variables: T, P, N − 1
­liquid-phase mole fractions (xi) and N − 1 vapor-phase mole fractions (yi). Thus, specification
of N of these variables, usually either T or P and either the liquid- or vapor-phase composition,
allows us to solve for the remaining N variables by BUBL P, DEW P, BUBL T, and DEW T
calculations.

Fugacity Coefficients from the Generic Cubic Equation of State
Cubic equations of state give Z as a function of the independent variables T and ρ (or V ). For
VLE calculations, expressions for the fugacity coefficient ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​must be given by an equation

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

Example 13.6
A vapor mixture of N2(1) and CH4(2) at 200 K and 30 bar contains 40 mol-% N2. Determine the fugacity coefficients of nitrogen and methane in the mixture by Eq. (13.99)

Eqs. (13.91) through (13.93). For a binary mixture they become:

Equations (13.77) and (13.99) provide the basis for VLE calculations for mixtures, but
they incorporate a number of mixture parameters (e.g., al, bv) and thermodynamic functions
(e.g., Zl, Zv) that may initially be unknown. The calculation therefore becomes one of solving
simultaneous equations equal in number to the number of unknowns. The equations available
fall into several classes: mixing- and combining-rule and parameter equations for the liquid
phase, the same equations for the vapor phase, and equilibrium and related equations. All
of these parameters and equations have already been presented, but they are classified for
convenience in Table 13.9. The presumption is that all pure-species parameters (e.g., ai and bi)
are known and that either the temperature T or pressure P and either the liquid-phase or vaporphase composition is specified. In addition to the N primary unknowns (T or P and either
liquid or vapor phase composition), Table 13.9 enumerates 12 + 4N auxiliary variables and a
total of 12 + 5N equations.

13.7. VLE from Cubic Equations of State

A direct and somewhat intuitive solution procedure makes use of Eq. (13.77), rewritten
as yi = Ki xi. Because ​∑​i​​y​i​= 1​,
	​
​∑​ ​​K​i​​x​i​= 1​
(13.102)
i

where Ki , the K-value, is given by:
​​ϕˆ​​l​  ​
	​
​K​i​= ​ ___iv ​​
(13.103)
​​ϕˆ​​i​  ​
Thus for bubblepoint calculations, where the liquid-phase composition is known, the problem
is to find the set of K-values that satisfies Eq. (13.102).

Example 13.7
Develop the Pxy diagram at 37.78°C for the methane(1)/n-butane(2) binary system.
Base calculations on the Soave/Redlich/Kwong equation with mixing rules given by
Eqs. (13.91) through (13.93). Experimental data at this temperature for comparison are
given by Sage et al.25

Solution 13.7
The procedure here is to do a BUBL P calculation for each experimental data
point. For each calculation, estimated values of P and y1 are required to initiate
iteration. These estimates are here provided by the experimental data. Where no
such data are available, several trials may be required to find values for which the
iterative procedure converges.
Pure-species parameters ai and bi are found from Eqs. (13.79) and (13.80) with
constants and an expression for α(Tr) from Table 3.1. For a temperature of 310.93 K
[37.78°C] and with critical constants and ωi from Table B.1, calculations provide
the following pure-species values:

The units of bi are cm3·mol−1, and those of ai are bar·cm6·mol−2.
Note that the temperature of interest is greater than the critical temperature of
methane. The Pxy diagram will therefore be of the type shown by Fig. 12.2(a) for
temperature Tb. The equations for α(Tr) given in Table 3.1 are based on vapor-­
pressure data, which extend only to the critical temperature. However, they may be
applied to temperatures modestly above the critical temperature.

where βl, βv, ql, and qv are given by Eqs. (13.89) and (13.90). The first set of BUBL P
calculations is made for the assumed pressure. With the given liquid-phase composition and assumed vapor-phase composition, values for Zl and Zv are determined by the preceding equations, and fugacity coefficients ​​​ϕˆ​​il​  ​​ and ​​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​​then follow
from Eq. (13.99). Values of K1 and K2 come from Eq. (13.103). The constraint
y1 + y2 = 1 has not been imposed, and Eq. (13.102) is unlikely to be satisfied. In
this event, K1x1+ K2x2 ≠ 1, and a new vapor composition for the next iteration is
given by the normalizing equation:
​K​1​​x​1​
	​
​y​1​= __________

This new vapor composition allows reevaluation of {​ ​​ϕˆ​​iv​  ​}​, {Ki}, and {Kixi}. If the

of calculations is repeated. Continued iteration leads to stable values of all quantities. If the sum K1x1 + K2x2 is not unity, the assumed pressure is incorrect, and
it must be adjusted according by some rational scheme. When ​∑​i​​K​i​​x​i​ > ​1​, P is
too low; when ​∑​i​​K​i​​x​i​ < ​1​, P is too high. The entire iterative procedure is then
repeated with a new pressure P. The last calculated values of yi are used for the
initial estimate of {yi}. The process continues until K1x1 + K2x2 = 1. Of course
the same result can be obtained by any other method capable of solving the set of
equations given in Table 13.9, with P, y1, and y2 as the unknowns.
The results of all calculations are shown by the solid lines of Fig. 13.13. Experimental values appear as points. The root-mean-square percentage difference
between experimental and calculated pressures is 3.9%, and the root-mean-square
deviation between experimental and calculated y values is 0.013. These results,
based on the simple mixing rules of Eqs. (13.91) and (13.92), are representative
for systems that exhibit modest and well-behaved deviations from ideal-solution
behavior, e.g., for systems comprised of hydrocarbons and cryogenic fluids.

FLASH CALCULATIONS

In previous sections, we have focused on bubblepoint and dewpoint calculations, which are
common calculations in practice, and which provide a basis for constructing phase diagrams
for VLE. Perhaps an even more important application of VLE is the flash calculation. The
name originates from the fact that a liquid at a pressure equal to or greater than its bubblepoint
pressure “flashes” or partially evaporates when the pressure is reduced below its bubblepoint
pressure, producing a two-phase system of vapor and liquid in equilibrium. We consider here
only the P, T-flash, which refers to any calculation of the quantities and compositions of the

504

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

vapor and liquid phases making up a two-phase system in equilibrium at known T, P, and
overall composition. This poses a problem known to be determinate on the basis of Duhem’s
theorem, because two independent variables (T and P) are specified for a system of fixed overall composition, that is, a system formed from given masses of nonreacting chemical species.
Consider a system containing one mole of nonreacting chemical species with an overall
composition represented by the set of mole fractions {zi}. Let ​ ​ be the moles of liquid, with
mole fractions {xi}, and let ​ ​ be the moles of vapor, with mole fractions {yi}. The material
balance equations are:
	​
+ = 1​	
	​
​z​i​= ​x​i​ + ​y​i​
(i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​
Combining these equations to eliminate

gives:

	​
​z​i​= ​x​i​(1 − ) + ​y​i​ ​

(13.104)

The K-value, as defined in the previous section (Ki ≡ yi∕xi), is a convenient construct for use in
flash calculations. Substituting xi = yi∕Ki into Eq. (13.104) and solving for yi yields:
​z​i​​K​i​
	​
​y​i​= ___________
​
​
​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​
1 + (​K​i​− 1)

(13.105)

Because ​​∑​i​​y​i​ = 1​, summing this expression over all species gives us a single equation in
which, for known K-values, the only unknown is ​ ​.
​z​i​​K​i​
	​
​∑​ ​___________
​
​= 1​

+
(​K​i​− 1)
i

(13.106)

One general approach to solving a P, T-flash problem is to find the value of ​ ​, between 0 and 1,
that satisfies this equation. Note that ​ ​= 1 is always a trivial solution to this e­ quation. Having
done so, the vapor-phase mole fractions are then obtained from Eq. (13.105), the l­iquid-phase
mole fractions are obtained from xi = yi∕Ki, and ​ ​is given by ​ ​= 1 ​−​ ​ ​. When Raoult’s law
can be applied, the K-values are constant and this is straightforward, as shown in the following
example. Historically, K-values for light hydrocarbons were often taken from a set of charts
constructed by DePriester, hence called DePriester charts. These similarly provided a set of
constant K-values for use in the preceding calculations.26

Example 13.8
The system acetone(1)/acetonitrile(2)/nitromethane(3) at 80°C and 110 kPa has the
overall composition z1 = 0.45, z2 = 0.35, z3 = 0.20. Assuming that Raoult’s law is
appropriate to this system, determine ​ ​, ​ ​, {xi}, and {yi}. The vapor pressures of the
pure species at 80°C are:
	​​P​1sat
​  ​ = 195.75

P

13.8. Flash Calculations

Solution 13.8
First, do a BUBL P calculation with {zi} = {xi} to determine Pbubl:
​P​bubl​= ​x​1​​P​1sat
​  ​ + ​x​2​​P​2sat
​  ​ + ​x​3​​P​3sat
​  ​
​P​bubl​= ​(0.45)​(195.75)​+ ​(0.35)​(97.84)​+ ​(0.20)​(50.32)​= 132.40 kPa​
Next, do a DEW P calculation with {zi} = {yi} to find Pdew:
1
	​
​P​dew​= _______________________
​     
  
 ​ = 101.52 kPa​
sat
​y​1​∕ ​P​1​  ​ + ​y​2​∕ ​P​2sat
​  ​ + ​y​3​∕ ​P​3sat
​  ​
Because the given pressure lies between Pbubl and Pdew, the system is in the twophase region, and a flash calculation is possible.
From Raoult’s law, Eq. (13.16), we have ​K​i​= ​y​i​∕ ​x​i​= ​Pi​sat
​  ​∕ P​, from which:
	​
​K​1​= 1.7795

​K​2​= 0.8895

​K​3​= 0.4575​

Substituting known values into Eq. (13.106) gives:
(​ 0.20)(​ 0.4575)​
(​ 0.45)(​ 0.7795)​ (​ 0.35)(​ 0.8895)​ ____________

​  
  ​+ ​  
  ​ = 1​
1 + 0.7795

Trial-and-error or iterative solution for

​x​3​= 0.3331​

Reassuringly, ​∑​i​​x​i​= ​∑​i​​y​i​= 1​.
The procedure of the preceding example is applicable regardless of the number of species
present. However, for the simple case of a binary flash calculation using Raoult’s law, explicit
solution is possible. In that case, we have:
	​
P = ​x​1​​P​1sat
​  ​ + ​x​2​​P​2sat
​  ​ = ​x​1​​P​1sat
​  ​ + ​(1 − ​x​1​)​​P​2sat
​  ​​
Solving for x1 gives:

P − ​P​sat
​  ​
	​
​x​1​= _________
​  sat 2 sat ​​
​P​1​  ​ − ​P​2​  ​
With x1 known, the remaining variables follow immediately from Raoult’s law [Eq. (13.16)]
and the overall mass balances [Eq. (13.104)].
When the K-values are not constant, the general approach remains the same as in
Ex. 13.8, but an additional level of iterative solution is required. In the preceding treatment,

506

CHAPTER 13. Thermodynamic Formulations for Vapor/Liquid Equilibrium

we solved for yi to obtain Eq. (13.105). If, instead, we eliminate yi using yi = Kixi, we obtain
an alternative expression:
​z​i​
	​
​x​i​= ___________
​
​
​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​(13.107)
1 + (​K​i​− 1)
Because both sets of mole fractions must sum to unity, ​∑​i​​x​i​ = ​∑​i​​y​i​ = 1​. Thus, if we sum
Eq. (13.105) over all species and subtract unity from this sum, the difference Fy is zero:
​z​i​​K​i​
	​
​Fy​ ​= ​∑​ ​___________
​
​− 1 = 0​(13.108)
1
+
(​K​i​− 1)
i
Similar treatment of Eq. (13.107) yields the difference Fx, which is also zero:
​z​i​
	​
​Fx​ ​= ​∑​ ​___________
​
​− 1 = 0​(13.109)
i 1 + (​K​i​− 1)
A P, T-flash problem can be solved by finding a value of that makes either Fy or Fx equal to
zero for known T, P, and overall composition. A more convenient function for applying a
general solution procedure27 is the difference F ≡ Fy ​−​Fx:
​z​i​(​​K​i​− 1​)​
	​
F = ​∑​ ​___________
​
​= 0​
1
+
(​K​i​− 1)

(13.110)

The advantage of this function is apparent from its derivative:

	​
​ ​= − ​∑​ ​______________
​   
  2 ​​
d
i [​​ 1 + (​K​i​− 1)]​​​  ​

(13.111)

Because dF∕d is always negative, the F vs. relation is monotonic. This, in turn, makes this
form of the equation exceptionally well-suited for solution by Newton’s method (App. H).
Equation H.1 for the nth iteration of Newton’s method becomes:
dF
	​
F + ​ ____
​ ​ ​Δ = 0​
(d )

(13.112)

where Δ ≡ n+1 ​−​ n, and F and (dF∕d ) are found by Eq. (13.110) and (13.111). In these
equations, for the general gamma/phi formulation of VLE, the K-values come from
Eq. (13.13), written:
​  ​
​y​i​ ​γ​i​​P​isat
	​
​K​i​= __
​ ​= _____
​ 
 ​
​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​
​x​i​ ​Φ​i​P

(13.113)

with the Φi given by Eq. (13.14). The K-values contain all of the thermodynamic information
and are related in a complex way to T, P, {yi}, and {xi}. Because solution is for {yi} and {xi},
the P, T-flash calculation inevitably requires iterative solution. This remains the case, even at
low pressure where we can assume Φi = 1, because the activity coefficients still depend upon
the unknown {xi}.
One typically proceeds by performing a BUBL P calculation and a DEW P calculation
prior to the flash calculation. If the given pressure is below Pdew for the specified T and {zi},

then the system exists as superheated vapor, and no flash calculation is possible. Similarly, if
the given pressure is above Pbubl for the specified T and {zi}, then the system is a subcooled
liquid, and no flash calculation is possible. If the specified P falls between Pdew and Pbubl
for the specified T and {zi}, then the system exists as an equilibrium mixture of vapor and
liquid, and we can proceed with the flash calculation. The results of the preliminary DEW
P and BUBL P calculations then provide useful initial estimates of {γi}, {​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​}, and . For the
dewpoint, = 1, with calculated values of Pdew, γi, dew, and ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​  i, dew​​​; for the bubblepoint, = 0,
with calculated values of Pbubl, γi, bubl, and ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​  i, bubl​​​. The simplest procedure is to interpolate
linearly between dewpoint and bubblepoint with respect to P:
​P​bubl​− P
	​
= __________
​
​​
​P​bubl​− ​P​dew​
P − ​P​dew​

​γ​i​= ​γ​i, dew​+ (​γ​i, bubl​− ​γ​i, dew​) __________

​
​​
​P​bubl​− ​P​dew​
With these initial values of the γi and ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​  i​​​, one can now calculate initial values of Ki from
Eq. (13.113). Using these values with Eqs. (13.110) and (13.111) one applies Newton’s
method, iterating on Eq. (13.112) to obtain a solution for . One then proceeds as in Ex. 13.8
to compute , {xi}, and {yi}. The computed compositions are used to obtain new estimates
of {γi} and {​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​}, from which new K-values are computed. The procedure is repeated until the
change in {xi} and {yi} from one iteration to the next is negligible. The same basic procedure
can be applied with K-values computed by application of a cubic equation of state to both
phases, as exemplified by Eq. (13.103).

mixtures of this system, to a good approximation, ​ln ​γ​1​= 0.64 ​x​22​  ​​ and l​ n ​γ​2​= 0.64 ​x​12​  ​​.

equilibrium vapor-phase mole fraction y1 corresponding to an equimolar liquid mixture is approximately

13.22. A process stream contains light species 1 and heavy species 2. A relatively pure liquid
stream containing mostly 2 is desired, obtained by a single-stage liquid/vapor separation. Specifications of the equilibrium composition are: x1 = 0.002 and y1 = 0.950.
Use data given below to determine T (K) and P (bar) for the separator. Assume that

least one must be less than 1.0. Offer a proof of this observation.

13.25. The NIST Chemistry WebBook reports critically evaluated Henry’s constants for
selected chemicals in water at 25°C. Henry’s constants from this source, denoted here
by kHi, appear in the VLE equation written for the solute in the form:
mi = kHiyiP
		where mi is the liquid-phase molality of solute species i, expressed as mol i∕kg solvent.
(a) Determine an algebraic relation connecting kHi to i, Henry’s constant in
Eq. (13.26). Assume that xi is “small.”
(b) The NIST Chemistry WebBook provides a value of 0.034 mol·kg−1·bar−1 for
kHi of CO2 in H2O at 25°C. What is the implied value of i in bar? Compare this
with the value given in Table 13.2, which came from a different source.
13.26. (a) A feed containing equimolar amounts of acetone(1) and acetonitrile(2) is throttled

(b) A feed containing equimolar amounts of acetone(1) and acetonitrile(2) is throttled

13.27. A binary mixture of benzene(1) and toluene(2) is flashed to 75 kPa and 90°C. Analysis of the effluent liquid and vapor streams from the separator yields: x1 = 0.1604 and
y1 = 0.2919. An operator remarks that the product streams are “off-spec,” and you are
asked to diagnose the problem.
(a) Verify that the exiting streams are not in binary equilibrium.
(b) Verify that an air leak into the separator could be the cause.

13.28. Ten (10) kmol·hr−1 of hydrogen sulfide gas is burned with the stoichiometric amount
of pure oxygen in a special unit. Reactants enter as gases at 25°C and 1(atm). Products
leave as two streams in equilibrium at 70°C and 1(atm): a phase of pure liquid water,
and a saturated vapor stream containing H2O and SO2.
(a) What is the composition (mole fractions) of the product vapor stream?
(b) What are the rates (kmol·hr−1) of the two product streams?
13.29. Physiological studies show the neutral comfort level (NCL) of moist air corresponds
to an absolute humidity of about 0.01 kg H2O per kg of dry air.
(a) What is the vapor-phase mole fraction of H2O at the NCL?
(b) What is the partial pressure of H2O at the NCL? Here, and in part (c), take P =
1.01325 bar.
(c) What is the dewpoint temperature (°F) at the NCL?
13.30. An industrial dehumidifier accepts 50 kmol·hr−1 of moist air with a dewpoint of 20°C.
Conditioned air leaving the dehumidifier has a dewpoint temperature of 10°C. At
what rate (kg·hr−1) is liquid water removed in this steady-flow process? Assume P is
constant at 1(atm).
13.31. Vapor/liquid-equilibrium azeotropy is impossible for binary systems rigorously
described by Raoult’s law. For real systems (those with γi ≠ 1), azeotropy is inevitable
at temperatures where the P​
​​ isat
​  ​​are equal. Such a temperature is called a Bancroft point.
Not all binary systems exhibit such a point. With Table B.2 of App. B as a resource,
identify three binary systems with Bancroft points, and determine the T and P coordinates. Ground rule: A Bancroft point must lie in the temperature ranges of validity of
the Antoine equations.

13.38. Equations analogous to Eqs. (10.15) and (10.16) apply for excess properties. Because
ln γi is a partial property with respect to GE∕RT, these analogous equations can be
written for ln γ1 and ln γ2 in a binary system.

the percentage loss of organic (molar basis) in the boil-off process. Comment on the

13.70. Work Prob. 13.69 for one of the following: (a) The Soave/Redlich/Kwong equation;
(b) the Peng/Robinson equation.
13.71. Departures from Raoult’s law are primarily from liquid-phase nonidealities (γi ≠ 1).
But vapor-phase nonidealities (​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​≠ 1) also contribute. Consider the special case
where the liquid phase is an ideal solution, and the vapor phase a nonideal gas mixture
described by Eq. (3.36). Show that departures from Raoult’s law at constant temperature are likely to be negative. State clearly any assumptions and approximations.
13.72. Determine a numerical value for the acentric factor ω implied by:
(a) The van der Waals equation;
(b) The Redlich/Kwong equation.
13.73. The relative volatility α12 is commonly used in applications involving binary VLE. In
particular (see Ex. 13.1), it serves as a basis for assessing the possibility of binary azeotropy. (a) Develop an expression for α12 based on Eqs. (13.13) and (13.14). (b) Specialize
the expression to the composition limits x1 = y1 = 0 and x1 =y1 = 1. Compare with the
result obtained from modified Raoult’s law, Eq. (13.19). The difference between the
results reflects the effects of vapor-phase nonidealities. (c) Further specialize the results
of part (b) to the case where the vapor phase is an ideal solution of real gases.
13.74. Although isothermal VLE data are preferred for extraction of activity coefficients, a
large body of good isobaric data exists in the literature. For a binary isobaric T-x1-y1
data set, one can extract point values of γi via Eq. (13.13):
​y​i​​Φ​i(​ ​T​k​, P, y)​P
	​
​γ​i​(x, ​T​k)​ ​= ____________
  
​ 
 ​​
​x​i​​P​isat
​  (​ ​T​k)​ ​
		 Here, the variable list for γi recognizes a primary dependence on x and T; pressure
dependence is normally negligible. The notation Tk emphasizes that temperature varies with data point across the composition range, and the calculated activity coefficients are at different temperatures. However, the usual goal of VLE data reduction
and correlation is to develop an appropriate expression for GE∕RT at a single temperature T. A procedure is needed to correct each activity coefficient to such a T chosen
near the average for the data set. If a correlation for HE(x) is available at or near this T,
show that the values of γi corrected to T can be estimated by the expression:
− ​​H¯ ​​E​  ​ T

Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

The transformation of raw materials into products of greater value by means of chemical reaction is a major industry, and a vast array of commercial products is obtained by chemical
synthesis. Sulfuric acid, ammonia, ethylene, propylene, phosphoric acid, chlorine, nitric acid,
urea, benzene, methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol are examples of chemicals produced
at scales of many billions of kg per year worldwide. These in turn are used in the large-scale
manufacture of fibers, paints, detergents, plastics, rubber, paper, and fertilizers, to name a
few. Other products produced by chemical reaction range from pharmaceuticals to the array
of inorganic materials that undergird the microelectronics and telecommunications industries.
While these are smaller in production volume than the commodity chemicals we have mentioned, their economic and societal impacts are also enormous. Clearly, the chemical engineer
must be familiar with chemical reactor design, analysis, and operation.
Both the rate and the equilibrium conversion of a chemical reaction depend on the temperature, pressure, and composition of reactants. Often, a reasonable reaction rate is achieved
only with a suitable catalyst. For example, the rate of oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur
trioxide, carried out with a vanadium pentoxide catalyst, becomes appreciable at about 300°C
and increases at higher temperatures. On the basis of rate alone, one would operate the reactor
at the highest practical temperature. However, the equilibrium conversion of sulfur dioxide
to sulfur trioxide falls as temperature rises, decreasing from about 90% at 520°C to about
50% at 680°C. These values represent maximum possible conversions regardless of catalyst or
reaction rate. It is clear that both equilibrium and rate must be considered in the exploitation
of chemical reactions for commercial purposes. Although reaction rates are not susceptible to
thermodynamic treatment, reaction equilibria are. Therefore, the central goal of this chapter
is to relate the equilibrium composition of reacting systems to their temperature, pressure, and
initial composition.
Many industrial reactions are not carried to equilibrium; reactor design is often based on
reaction rate or on other considerations such as rates of heat and mass transfer. However, the
choice of operating conditions may still be influenced by equilibrium considerations. Moreover, the equilibrium state provides reference against which to measure improvements in a
process. Similarly, chemical equilibrium considerations often determine whether investigation
of a new process is worthwhile. For example, if thermodynamic analysis indicates that a yield
of only 20% is possible at equilibrium and if a 50% yield is necessary for a process to be
economically attractive, there is no purpose in proceeding with further analysis. On the other
524

525

14.1. The Reaction Coordinate

hand, if the equilibrium yield is 80%, further studies of reaction rates and other aspects of the
process may be warranted.
Reaction stoichiometry is treated in Sec. 14.1, where we relate composition of a reacting
mixture to a single reaction coordinate variable for each chemical reaction that occurs. Criteria for chemical reaction equilibrium are then introduced in Sec. 14.2. The equilibrium constant is defined in Sec. 14.3, and its temperature dependence and evaluation are considered in
Secs. 14.4 and 14.5. The relationship between the equilibrium constant and composition is
developed in Sec. 14.6. The calculation of equilibrium conversions for single reactions is
taken up in Sec. 14.7. In Sec. 14.8, the phase rule is reconsidered in the context of reacting
systems. Multiple reaction equilibrium is treated in Sec. 14.9.1 Finally, in Sec. 14.10 the fuel
cell is given an introductory treatment.

14.1

THE REACTION COORDINATE

The general chemical reaction, as written in Sec. 4.6 is:
	​​​|​​ ​ν​1​|​​​​A​1​+ ​​|​​ ​ν​2​  ​|​​​  ​A​2​+ · · · → ​​|​​​ν​3​  ​|​​ ​​A​3​+ ​​|​​​ν​4​  ​|​​​  ​A​4​+ · · ·​

(14.1)

where ∣ νi ∣ is a stoichiometric coefficient and Ai represents a chemical formula. The symbol νi
itself is called a stoichiometric number, and by the sign convention of Sec. 4.6 it is:
​positive (+) for a product  and  negative (−) for a reactant​
Thus for the reaction,    ​
​CH​4​+ ​H​2​O → CO + 3​H​2​
the stoichiometric numbers are:
​ν​​CH​4​​ = −1  ​ν​​H​2​O​= −1  ​ν​CO​= 1  ​ν​​H​2​​ = 3​
The stoichiometric number for a species that does not participate in the reaction, that is, an
inert species, is zero.
As the reaction represented by Eq. (14.1) progresses, the changes in the numbers of
moles of species present are in direct proportion to the stoichiometric numbers. Thus for the
preceding reaction, if 0.5 mol of CH4 disappears by reaction, 0.5 mol of H2O also disappears;
simultaneously 0.5 mol of CO and 1.5 mol of H2 are formed. Applied to a differential amount
of reaction, this principle provides the equations:

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

All terms being equal, they can be identified collectively by a single quantity representing an
amount of reaction. Thus dε, a single variable representing the extent to which the reaction has
proceeded, is defined by the equation:
d​n​1​ d​n​2​ _
d​n​3​ d​n​4​
	​​​_​= _
​ ​= ​ ​= _
​ ​= · · · ≡ dε​​	
​ν​1​ ​ν​2​ ​ν​3​ ​ν​4​

(14.2)

The general relation connecting the differential change dni with dε is therefore:
	​​d​n​i​= ​ν​i​dε  (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​​	

(14.3)

This new variable ε, called the reaction coordinate, characterizes the extent or degree to
which a reaction has taken place.2 Only changes in ε with respect to changes in a mole number are defined by Eq. (14.3). The definition of ε itself depends for a specific application on
setting it equal to zero for the initial state of the system prior to reaction. Thus, integration of
Eq. (14.3) from an initial unreacted state where ε = 0 and ni = ​n​​i​0​​ to a state reached after an
arbitrary amount of reaction gives:
​n​i​

ε

​  ​d ​​n​​= ​ν​i​ ​  ​d ​ε​
∫​n​​i​0​​ i
∫0
​​

or	​
​n​i​= ​n​​i​0​​ + ​ν​i​  ε   (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​

(14.4)

Summation over all species yields:
​n = ​∑​ ​​n​i​= ​∑​ ​​n​​i​0​​ + ε ​∑​ ​​ν​i​
i

i

or	​
n = ​n​0​+ νε​
where	​
n ≡ ​∑​ ​​n​i​   ​n​0​≡ ​∑​ ​​n​​i​0​​   ν ≡ ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​

Thus the mole fractions yi of the species present are related to ε by:

	​
​y​i​= _

​n​0​+ νε

(14.5)

Application of this equation is illustrated in the following examples.

Example 14.1
The following reaction occurs in a system initially consisting of 2 mol CH4, 1 mol H2O,
1 mol CO, and 4 mol H2:
​CH​4​+ ​H​2​O → CO + 3​H​2​
Determine expressions for the mole fractions yi as functions of ε.
2The reaction coordinate ε has been given various names, including degree of advancement, degree of reaction,
extent of reaction, and progress variable.

find expressions that relate the number of moles and the mole fraction of each chemical species to the reaction coordinate ε.

Solution 14.2

For the given reaction, ​ν = −1 + 1 + _​12 ​= _​12 ​. Application of Eqs. (14.4) and (14.5)

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

The νi are pure numbers without units; Eq. (14.3) therefore requires ε to be expressed
in moles. This leads to the concept of a mole of reaction, meaning a change in ε of one mole.
When Δε = 1 mol, the reaction proceeds to such an extent that the change in mole number of
each reactant and product is equal to its stoichiometric number.

Multireaction Stoichiometry
When two or more independent reactions proceed simultaneously, a second subscript, here
indicated by j, serves as the reaction index. A separate reaction coordinate εj then applies to
each reaction. The stoichiometric numbers are doubly subscripted to identify their association
with both a species and a reaction. Thus νi, j designates the stoichiometric number of species
i in reaction j. Because the number of moles of a species ni may change because of several
reactions, the general equation analogous to Eq. (14.3) includes a sum:
​d​n​i​= ​∑​ ​   ​ν​i, j​d​ε​j​   (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​
j

Integration from ni = ​n​​i​0​​​ and εj = 0 to arbitrary ni and εj gives:
	​
​n​i​= ​n​​i​0​​ + ​∑​ ​​ν​i, j​​ε​j​   (i = 1, 2, . . . , N )​
j

(14.6)

Summing over all species yields:

​n = ​∑​ ​​n​​i​0​​ + ​∑​ ​​∑​ ​​ν​i, j​​ε​j​= ​n​0​+ ​∑​ ​ ​∑​ ​​ν​i, j​ ​ε​j​
(i

The definition of a total stoichiometric number ν (≡ Σi νi) for a single reaction has its counterpart here in the definition:

The composition of the system is a function of independent variables ε1 and ε2.

14.2 APPLICATION OF EQUILIBRIUM CRITERIA
TO CHEMICAL REACTIONS
In Sec. 12.4 we proved that the total Gibbs energy of a closed system at constant T and P must
decrease during an irreversible process and that the condition for equilibrium is reached when
Gt attains its minimum value. At this equilibrium state,
	​
​(d​G​t​)​T, P​= 0​

(12.3)

Thus if a mixture of chemical species is not in chemical equilibrium, any reaction that occurs
at constant T and P must decrease the total Gibbs energy of the system. The significance of
this for a single chemical reaction is illustrated in Fig. 14.1, which shows a schematic diagram
of Gt vs. ε, the reaction coordinate. Because ε is the single variable that characterizes the progress of the reaction, and therefore the composition of the system, the total Gibbs energy at
constant T and P is determined by ε. The arrows along the curve in Fig. 14.1 indicate the directions of changes in (Gt)T, P that are possible on account of reaction. The reaction coordinate
has its equilibrium value εe at the minimum of the curve. The meaning of Eq. (12.3) is that
differential displacements of the chemical reaction can occur at the equilibrium state without
causing changes in the total Gibbs energy of the system.

Figure 14.1 indicates the two distinctive features of the equilibrium state for given temperature and pressure:
∙ The total Gibbs energy Gt is a minimum.     ∙ Its differential is zero.
Each of these may serve as a criterion of equilibrium. Thus, we may write an expression for
Gt as a function of ε and seek the value of ε that minimizes Gt, or we may differentiate the
expression, equate it to zero, and solve for ε. The latter procedure is almost always used for
single reactions (Fig. 14.1), and it leads to the method of equilibrium constants, as described
in the following sections. Although the method of equilibrium constants can also be applied to
multiple reactions, direct minimization of Gt is often more convenient. The direct minimization approach is considered in Sec. 14.9.
Although the equilibrium expressions are developed for closed systems at constant T
and P, they are not restricted in application to systems that are actually closed and reach equilibrium states along paths of constant T and P. Once an equilibrium state is reached, no further
changes occur, and the system continues to exist in this state at fixed T and P. How this state
was actually attained does not matter. Once it is known that an equilibrium state exists at given
T and P, the criteria apply.

14.3 THE STANDARD GIBBS-ENERGY CHANGE
AND THE ­EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT
The next step in applying the criterion of equilibrium to chemical reactions is to relate the
Gibbs energy, which is minimized at equilibrium, to the reaction coordinate. Equation (10.2),
the fundamental property relation for single-phase systems, provides an expression for the
total differential of the Gibbs energy:
d(nG) = (nV)dP − (nS)dT + ​∑​ ​​μ​i​  d​n​i​(10.2)
i

14.3. The Standard Gibbs-Energy Change and the ­Equilibrium Constant

531

If changes in the mole numbers ni occur as the result of a single chemical reaction in a closed
system, then by Eq. (14.3) each dni may be replaced by the product νi dε. Equation (10.2) then
becomes:
d(nG) = (nV)dP − (nS)dT + ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​μ​i​dε
i

Because nG is a state function, the right side of this equation is an exact differential expression; whence,
∂ (nG  )
∂ (​G​t​  )
	​
​∑​ ​​ν​i​​μ​i​= ​​ ​​ ______
 ​
​ ​​  ​​  = ​​ ​​ _____
 ​
​ ​​  ​​​
[ ∂ ε ] T, P [ ∂ ε ] T, P
i
Thus the quantity ​∑​i​​ν​i​​μ​i​ represents, in general, the rate of change of total Gibbs energy of
the system with respect to the reaction coordinate at constant T and P. Figure 14.1 shows that
this quantity is zero at the equilibrium state. A criterion of chemical-reaction equilibrium is
therefore:
	​​​∑​ ​​ν​i​​μ​i​= 0​​
i

(14.8)

Recall the definition of the fugacity of a species in solution:
	​
​μ​i​= ​Γ​i​​(T  )​+ RT ln   ​f ​ˆi​

(10.46)

In addition, Eq. (10.31) may be written for pure species i in its standard state3 at the same
temperature:
​​G​  i°​  ​  = ​Γ​i(​ T  )​+ RT ln    ​f​  i°​  ​​
The difference between these two equations is:
​​fˆ​​  i​​
	​
​μ​i​− ​G​  i°​  ​  = RT ln __
​  ° ​​
​f​  i​  ​

(14.9)

Combining Eq. (14.8) with Eq. (14.9) to eliminate µi gives for the equilibrium state of a chemical reaction:
​∑​ ​ν​i​[​G​  i°​  ​+ RT   ln​(​​​fˆ​​  i​​   ∕   ​f​  i°​  )​ ​]​= 0​

Also by definition,	​
Δ​G​​  °​  ≡ ​∑​ ​​ν​i​​G​  i°​  ​​
i

(14.12)

Because ​​G​  i°​  ​​is a property of pure species i in its standard state at fixed pressure, it depends
only on temperature. Thus, Eq. (14.12) implies that ΔG°, and hence K, are also functions only
of temperature.
Despite its dependence on temperature, K is called the equilibrium constant for the reaction; ΔG° is called the standard Gibbs-energy change
of reaction.
The fugacity ratios in Eq. (14.10) provide the connection between the equilibrium state
of interest and the standard states of the individual species, for which data are presumed to
be available, as discussed in Sec. 14.5. The standard states are arbitrary, but they must always
be at the equilibrium temperature T. The standard states selected need not be the same for all
species taking part in a reaction. However, for a particular species the standard state represented by G​ 
​​ i°​  ​​must be the same state as for the fugacity of that species, f​ ​​ i°​  ​​.
The function ​Δ​G​​  °​  ≡ ​∑​i​   ​ν​i​​G​  i°​  ​​in Eq. (14.12) is the difference between the Gibbs energies of the products and reactants (weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients) when each
is in its standard state as a pure substance at the standard-state pressure, but at the system
temperature. Thus the value of ΔG° is fixed for a given reaction once the temperature is established, and it is independent of pressure and composition. Other standard property changes of
reaction are similarly defined. Thus, for the general property M:
	​
Δ​M​​  °​  ≡ ​∑​ ​​  ν​i​​M​  i°​  ​​
i

In accord with this, ΔH ° is defined by Eq. (4.15) and ​Δ​C​  P°​ ​​by Eq. (4.17). These quantities
are functions only of temperature for a given reaction, and they are related to one another by
equations analogous to property relations for pure species.
For example, the relation between the standard heat of reaction and the standard
Gibbs-energy change of reaction may be developed from Eq. (6.39) written for species i in its
standard state:
d(​G​  i°​  ​∕ RT   )
	​​H​  i°​  ​ = −R​T​2​_________
​ 
 ​
​
dT
Total derivatives are appropriate here because the properties in the standard state are functions
of temperature only. Multiplication of both sides of this equation by νi and summation over all
species gives:
d​(​∑ i​  ​ν​i​​G​  i°​  ​∕ RT)​
_____________
	​
​∑​ ​​ν​i​​H​  i°​  ​ = −R ​T​2​

In view of the definitions of Eqs. (4.15) and (14.12), this may be written:

14.4. Effect of Temperature on the Equilibrium Constant

533

14.4 
EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE
EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT
Because the standard-state temperature is that of the equilibrium mixture, the standard property changes of reaction, such as ΔG° and ΔH°, vary with the equilibrium temperature. The
dependence of ΔG° on T is given by Eq. (14.13), which may be rewritten:
−Δ​H​​  °​

(14.14)

Equation (14.14) describes the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant, and hence
on the equilibrium conversion. If ΔH° is negative, i.e., if the reaction is exothermic, the equilibrium constant decreases as the temperature increases. Conversely, K increases with T for an
endothermic reaction.
If ΔH°, the standard enthalpy change (heat) of reaction, is assumed to be independent
of T, integration of Eq. (14.14) from a particular temperature T  ′ to an arbitrary temperature T
leads to the simple result:
K

(14.15)
(

This approximate equation implies that a plot of ln K vs. the reciprocal of absolute temperature is a straight line. Figure 14.2, a plot of ln K vs. 1/T for a number of common reactions,
illustrates this near linearity. Thus, Eq. (14.15) provides a reasonably accurate relation for the
interpolation and extrapolation of equilibrium-constant data.
The rigorous development of the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant is
based on the definition of the Gibbs energy, written for a chemical species in its standard
state:
	​​G​  i°​  ​ = ​H​  i°​  ​− T  ​S​  i°​  ​​
Multiplication by νi and summation over all species gives:

where ΔS° and Δ
​ ​S​  0° ​​​  are standard entropy changes of reaction at temperature T and at reference

When the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of each species is given by
Eq. (4.4), the first integral on the right side of Eq. (14.18) is given by Eq. (4.19), represented

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

The integral is evaluated by a function of exactly the same form as given by Eq. (5.11), and the
same computer program therefore serves for evaluation of either integral. The only difference
is in the name of the function, here: IDCPS(T0,T;DA,DB,DC,DD). By definition,

Thus ΔG°∕RT (= −ln K) as given by Eq. (14.18) is readily calculated at any temperature from the standard heat of reaction and the standard Gibbs-energy change of reaction at a
reference temperature (usually 298.15 K), and from two functions which can be evaluated by
standard computational procedures.
The preceding equations may be reorganized so as to factor K into three terms, each
representing a basic contribution to its value:
	​
K = ​K​0​​K​1​​K​2​​

The second factor K1 is a multiplier that accounts for the major effect of temperature, such
that the product K0 K1 is the equilibrium constant at temperature T when the heat of reaction is
assumed to be independent of temperature:

EVALUATION OF EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS

Values of ΔG° for many formation reactions are tabulated in standard references.4 The
reported values of ​ΔG

NBS Tables of Chemical Thermodynamic Properties,” J. Physical and Chemical Reference Data, vol. 11, supp. 2, 1982.

14.5. Evaluation of Equilibrium Constants

The determination of Δ
​ ​S​  f°​  ​​may be based on the third law of thermodynamics, discussed
in Sec. 5.9. Combination of values from Eq. (5.35) for the absolute entropies of the species
taking part in the reaction gives the value of Δ
​ S​ ​  f°​  ​​. Entropies (and heat capacities) are also commonly determined by applying statistical mechanics to molecular structure data obtained from
spectroscopic measurements or from computational quantum chemistry methods.5
Values of Δ
​ ​G​  ​f°​298
 ​​​​ for a limited number of chemical compounds are listed in Table C.4 of
App. C. These are for a temperature of 298.15 K, as are the values of ​Δ​H​  ​f°​298
 ​​​​ listed in the same
table. Values of ΔG° for other reactions are calculated from formation-reaction values in
exactly the same way that ΔH  ° values for other reactions are determined from formation-­
reaction values (Sec. 4.4). In more extensive compilations of data, values of ​ΔG
​ ​  f°​  ​​ and ​ΔH
​ ​  f°​  ​​ are
given for a range of temperatures, rather than only at 298.15 K. Where data are lacking, methods of estimation are available; these have been reviewed by Poling, Prausnitz, and
O’Connell.6

14.6 RELATION OF EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS
TO COMPOSITION
Gas-Phase Reactions
The standard state for a gas is the ideal-gas state of the pure gas at the standard-state pressure
P° of 1 bar. Because the fugacity of an ideal gas is equal to its pressure, ​​f​  i°​  ​ = ​P​​  °​​for each species i. Thus for gas-phase reactions f​​​ˆ​​  i​​ ∕​f​  i°​  ​  = ​​fˆ​​  i​​∕​P​​  °​​, and Eq. (14.10) becomes:
​ν​i​
​​f ​ˆ​  i​​
	​
​∏​ ​ ​___
​  ° ​​ ​​​  ​  = K​
i ( ​P​​  ​)

(14.25)

The equilibrium constant K depends only on temperature, but the fugacities are functions of pressure and composition as well. Eq. (14.25) relates K to fugacities of the reacting
species as they exist in the real equilibrium mixture. These fugacities reflect the nonidealities
of the equilibrium mixture and are functions of temperature, pressure, and composition. This
means that for a fixed temperature the composition at equilibrium must change with pressure
in such a way that ​∏i​(​​​fˆ​​  i  ​​∕P
​ ​​  °)​​​    ​​​​  νi​  ​​​​ remains constant.
The fugacity is related to the fugacity coefficient by Eq. (10.52):
	​​​fˆ​​  i​​  = ​​ϕˆ​​  i​​ ​y​i​P​
Substitution of this equation into Eq. (14.25) provides an equilibrium expression displaying
the pressure and the composition dependence more explicitly:
P −ν
ν
	​​​∏​ ​(​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​) ​​  i​= ​​ ___
​​  ° ​​ ​​​  ​K​​
( ​P​​  ​)
i

(14.26)

where ν ≡ Σi νi and P° is the standard-state pressure of 1 bar, expressed in the same units used
for P. The {yi} may be eliminated in favor of the equilibrium value of the reaction coordinate
εe. Then, for a fixed temperature Eq. (14.26) relates εe to P. In principle, specification of the
pressure allows solution for εe. However, the problem may be complicated by the dependence
of ϕ
​​ ˆi​​on composition, i.e., on εe. The methods of Secs. 10.6 and 10.7 can be applied to the
calculation of ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​  i​​​values, for example, by Eq. (10.64). Because of the complexity of the calculations, an iterative procedure, initiated by setting ϕ
​​​ˆ​​  i​​​  = 1 and formulated for computer solution,
is appropriate. Once the initial set {yi} is calculated, the {​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​} are evaluated, and the procedure
is repeated to convergence.
If the assumption that the equilibrium mixture is an ideal solution is justified, then
each ​​​ϕˆ ​​  i​​​ becomes ​​ϕi​  ​​​, the fugacity coefficient of pure species i at T and P [Eq. (10.84)]. In this
case, Eq. (14.26) becomes:
P −ν
	​​​∏​ ​(​y​i​​ϕi​  ​​)ν ​​  i​= ​​ ___
​​  ° ​​ ​​​  ​K​​
( ​P​​  ​)
i

(14.27)

Each ​​ϕi​  ​​​for a pure species can be evaluated from a generalized correlation once the equilibrium T and P are specified.

540

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

For pressures sufficiently low or temperatures sufficiently high, the equilibrium mixture
behaves essentially as an ideal gas. In this event, each ϕ
​​​ˆ ​​  i​​​ = 1, and Eq. (14.26) reduces to:
P −ν
	​​​∏​ ​( ​y​i​)ν ​​  i​= ​​ ___
​​  ° ​​ ​​​  ​K​​
( ​P​​  ​)
i

(14.28)

In this equation the temperature-, pressure-, and composition-dependent terms are distinct and
separate, and solution for any one of εe, T , or P, given the other two, is straightforward.
Although Eq. (14.28) holds only for a reaction occurring at a mixture in the ideal-gas
state, we can draw some conclusions from it that are true in general:
∙ According to Eq. (14.14), the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant K is
determined by the sign of ΔH°. Thus when ΔH° is positive, i.e., when the standard reaction is endothermic, an increase in T results in an increase in K. Equation (14.28) shows
that an increase in K at constant P results in an increase in ​∏i​  ( yi )​   ​​​​  νi​  ​​​​ ; this implies a shift
of the reaction equilibrium toward the products, and thus an increase in εe. Conversely,
when ΔH° is negative, that is, when the standard reaction is exothermic, an increase in
T causes a decrease in K and a decrease in ​∏i​  ( yi )​   ​​​​  νi​  ​​​​  at constant P. This implies a shift of
the reaction equilibrium toward the reactants, and a decrease in εe.
∙ Eq. (14.28) shows that when the total stoichiometric number ν (≡ ∑i νi) is negative, an
increase in P at constant T causes an increase in ​∏i​  ( yi )​   ​​​​  νi​  ​​​​ , implying a shift of the reaction
equilibrium toward the products, and an increase in εe. If ν is positive, an increase in P
at constant T causes a decrease in ​∏i​  ( yi )​   ​​​​  νi​  ​​​​ , a shift of the reaction equilibrium toward the
reactants, and a decrease in εe.

Liquid-Phase Reactions
For a reaction occurring in the liquid phase, we return to:
	​
​∏​ ​​(  ​​fˆ​​  i​​ ∕ ​f​  i°​  ​) ​​ ​ν​i​​  = K​
i

(14.10)

The usual standard state for liquids is the pure liquid i at the temperature of the system and at
1 bar, for which the fugacity is ​​f​  i°​  ​​.
According to Eq. (13.2), which defines the activity coefficient,
	​​​fˆ​​  i​​  = ​γ​i​​x​i​  ​fi​​​
where fi is the fugacity of pure liquid i at the temperature and pressure of the equilibrium mixture. The fugacity ratio can now be expressed:
​​fˆ​​  i​​ ​γ​i​​x​i​  ​fi​​
​fi​​
	​​ __° ​  = ​ _____
 ​  = ​γ​i​​x​i​ ​ ​ __° ​​ ​​​
( ​f​  i​  ​)
​f​  i​  ​
​f​  i°​  ​

(14.29)

Because the fugacities of liquids are weak functions of pressure, the ratio ​fi​​∕ ​f​  i°​  ​​is often taken as
unity. However, it is readily evaluated. For pure liquid i, Eq. (10.31) is written twice, first for

14.6. Relation of Equilibrium Constants to Composition

temperature T and pressure P, and then for the same temperature T but for the ­standard-state
pressure P°. The difference between these two equations is:
​fi​​
	​
​G​i​− ​G​  i°​  ​  = RT ln __
​  ° ​​
​f​  i​  ​
Integration of Eq. (6.11) at constant temperature T for the change of state of pure liquid i from
P° to P yields:

As a result,	​RT ln   __

Because Vi changes little with pressure for liquids (and solids), integration from P° to P assuming constant Vi is generally an excellent approximation. This integration gives:

Except for high pressures, the exponential term is close to unity and may be omitted. Then,
	​
​∏​ ​​(​x​i​​γ​i​)​​ν​i​​= K​
i

(14.32)

and the only problem is determination of the activity coefficients. One may apply an equation
such as the Wilson equation [Eq. (13.45)], or the UNIFAC method [App. G], and the compositions can be found from Eq. (14.32) by a complex iterative computer program. However, the
relative ease of experimental investigation for liquid mixtures has worked against the application of Eq. (14.32).
If the equilibrium mixture is an ideal solution, then ​γ​i​is unity, and Eq. (14.32) becomes:
	​
​∏​ ​​(​x​i​)​​ν​i​​= K​
i

(14.33)

This simple relation is known as the law of mass action. Because liquids often form nonideal
solutions, Eq. (14.33) can be expected in many cases to yield poor results.
For species known to be present in high concentration, the equation f​​​ˆ​​  i​​ ∕​​​fi​​​ = ​x​i​ is usually nearly correct. The reason, as discussed in Sec. 13.3, is that the Lewis/Randall rule
[Eq. (10.83)] always becomes valid for a species as its concentration approaches xi = 1.
For species at low concentration in aqueous solution, a different procedure has been widely
adopted, because in this case the equality of f​​​ˆ​​  i​​ ∕​​​fi​​​ and xi is usually far from correct. The method
is based on the use of a fictitious or hypothetical standard state for the solute, taken as the state

542

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

that would exist if the solute obeyed Henry’s law up to a molality m of unity.7 In this application, Henry’s law is expressed as
	​​​f ​ˆ​  i​​ = ​ki​​​m​i​​

(14.34)

and it is always valid for a species whose concentration approaches zero. This hypothetical
state is illustrated in Fig. 14.3. The dashed line drawn tangent to the curve at the origin represents Henry’s law, and it is valid in the case shown to a molality much less than unity.
However, one can calculate the properties the solute would have if it obeyed Henry’s law to a
concentration of 1 molal, and this hypothetical state often serves as a convenient standard state
for solutes.

The standard-state fugacity is

Hence, for any species at a concentration low enough for Henry’s law to hold,

(14.35)

The advantage of this standard state is that it provides a very simple relation between fugacity
and concentration for cases in which Henry’s law is at least approximately valid. Its range does
not commonly extend to a concentration of 1 molal. In the rare case where it does, the standard
state is a real state of the solute. This standard state is useful only where ΔG° data are available for the standard state of a 1-molal solution. Otherwise, the equilibrium constant cannot be
evaluated by Eq. (14.11).
7Molality is a measure of solute concentration, expressed as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

EQUILIBRIUM CONVERSIONS FOR SINGLE REACTIONS

Suppose a single reaction occurs in a homogeneous system, and suppose the equilibrium
constant is known. In this event, the calculation of the phase composition at equilibrium
is straightforward if the phase is assumed to be in the ideal-gas state [Eq. (14.28)] or if it
can be treated as an ideal solution [Eq. (14.27) or (14.33)]. When an assumption of ideality
is not reasonable, the problem is still tractable for gas-phase reactions through application
of an equation of state and solution by computer. For heterogeneous systems, where more
than one phase is present, the problem is more complicated and requires the superposition
of the criterion for phase equilibrium developed in Sec. 10.6. At equilibrium, there can be
no tendency for change to occur, either by mass transfer between phases or by chemical
reaction. We present in what follows, mainly by example, procedures useful for carrying
out equilibrium calculations, first, for single-phase reactions, and second, for heterogeneous reactions.

Single-Phase Reactions
The following examples illustrate the application of equations developed in the preceding
sections.

Example 14.5
The water-gas-shift reaction,
​CO(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → ​CO​2​(g) + ​H​2​(g)​
is carried out under several sets of conditions enumerated below. Calculate the fraction of steam reacted in each case. Assume the mixture behaves as an ideal gas.
(a) The reactants consist of 1 mol of H2O vapor and 1 mol of CO. The temperature
is 1100 K and the pressure is 1 bar.
(b) Same as (a) except that the pressure is 10 bar.
(c) Same as (a) except that 2 mol of N2 is included in the reactants.
(d) The reactants are 2 mol of H2O and 1 mol of CO. Other conditions are the
same as in (a).
(e) The reactants are 1 mol of H2O and 2 mol of CO. Other conditions are the
same as in (a).
(f) The initial mixture consists of 1 mol of H2O, 1 mol of CO, and 1 mol of CO2.
Other conditions are the same as in (a).
(g) Same as (a) except that the temperature is 1650 K.

544

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

Solution 14.5
(a) For the given reaction at 1100 K, 104/T = 9.05, and from Fig. 14.2, ln K = 0
and K = 1. For this reaction ν = ∑i νi = 1 + 1 − 1 − 1 = 0. Because the reaction
mixture can be treated as an ideal gas, Eq. (14.28) applies, and here becomes:

​(​1 − ​ε​e​)​2​
Therefore the fraction of the steam that reacts is 0.5.
(b) Because ν = 0, the increase in pressure has no effect on the ideal-gas reaction,
and εe is still 0.5.
(c) The N2 does not take part in the reaction and serves only as a diluent. It does
increase the initial number of moles n0 from 2 to 4, and the mole fractions are all
reduced by a factor of 2. However, Eq. (A) is unchanged and reduces to the same
expression as before. Therefore, εe is again 0.5.

(e) Here the expressions for yCO and ​​y​​H​2​O​​are interchanged, but this leaves the
equilibrium equation the same as in (d). Therefore εe = 0.667, and the fraction of
steam that reacts is 0.667.

14.7. Equilibrium Conversions for Single Reactions
The reaction is exothermic, and the extent of reaction decreases with increasing
temperature.

Example 14.6
Estimate the maximum conversion of ethylene to ethanol by vapor-phase hydration at
250°C and 35 bar for an initial steam-to-ethylene molar ratio of 5.

Solution 14.6
The calculation of K for this reaction is treated in Ex. 14.4. For a temperature of
250°C or 523.15 K the calculation yields:
	​
K = 10.02 × ​10​​−3​​
The appropriate equilibrium expression is Eq. (14.26). This equation requires evaluation of the fugacity coefficients of the species present in the equilibrium mixture.
This can be accomplished with Eq. (10.64). However, the calculations involve iteration
because the fugacity coefficients are functions of composition. For purposes of illustration, we assume here that the reaction mixture can be treated as an ideal solution, which
eliminates the need for iteration. This calculation would also serve as the first iteration
of a more rigorous calculation using mixture fugacity coefficients from Eq. (10.64).
With the assumption of ideal solution behavior, Eq. (14.26) reduces to Eq. (14.27),
which requires fugacity coefficients of the pure gases of the reacting mixture at the
equilibrium T and P. Because ν = ∑i   νi = −1, this equation becomes:

ε​  2e​  ​− 6.000  ​ε​e​+ 1.342 = 0​
(5 − ​ε​e​) (1 − ​ε​e​)
The solution to this quadratic equation for the smaller root is εe = 0.233. Because
the larger root is greater than unity, and would therefore correspond to a negative
mole fraction of ethylene, it does not represent a physically possible result. The maximum conversion of ethylene to ethanol under the stated conditions is therefore
23.3%. To carry out a more rigorous calculation without assuming that the gases
form an ideal solution, one would next evaluate the mixture fugacity coefficients
from Eq. (10.64), use the resulting values in Eq. (B), and calculate a new value
of εe and then iterate until the value of εe stops changing. However, this is rarely
necessary in practice.
In this reaction, increasing the temperature decreases K and hence the conversion. Increasing the pressure increases the conversion. Equilibrium considerations
therefore suggest that the operating pressure be as high as possible (limited by
condensation) and the temperature as low as possible. However, even with the best
catalyst known, the minimum temperature for a reasonable reaction rate is about
150°C. This is an instance where both equilibrium and reaction rate influence the
commercial viability of a reaction process.
The equilibrium conversion is a function of temperature, T, pressure, P, and the
steam-to-ethylene ratio in the feed, a. The effects of all three variables are shown
in Fig. 14.4. The curves in this figure come from calculations like those illustrated
in this example, except that a less precise relation for K as a function of T was
used. Comparing the families of curves for different pressures, and the curves for
different steam-to-ethylene ratios at a given pressure, illustrates how increasing
P or a allows one to reach a given equilibrium ethylene conversion at higher T.

Example 14.7
In a laboratory investigation, acetylene is catalytically hydrogenated to ethylene at
1120°C and 1 bar. If the feed is an equimolar mixture of acetylene and hydrogen, what
is the composition of the product stream at equilibrium?

written as follows:

This result is in good agreement with experiment, even though the assumption

yields a measured mole fraction of ethyl acetate at equilibrium of about 0.33.

Reactions in Heterogeneous Systems
When liquid and gas phases are both present in an equilibrium mixture of reacting species,
Eq. (10.48), a criterion of vapor/liquid equilibrium, must be satisfied along with the equation
of chemical-reaction equilibrium. Suppose, for example, that gas A reacts with liquid water
B to form an aqueous solution C. Several methods of treatment exist. The reaction may be
considered to occur in the gas phase with transfer of material between phases to maintain
phase equilibrium. In this case, the equilibrium constant is evaluated from ΔG° data based on
standard states for the species as gases, that is, the ideal-gas states at 1 bar and the reaction
temperature. Alternatively, the reaction may be considered to occur in the liquid phase, in
which case ΔG° is based on standard states for the species as liquids. Finally, the reaction
may be written:
	​
A(g) + B(l  ) → C(aq)​

552

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

in which case the ΔG° value is for mixed standard states: C as a solute in an ideal 1-molal
aqueous solution, B as a pure liquid at 1 bar, and A as a pure ideal gas at 1 bar. For this
choice of standard states, the relationship between the composition and equilibrium constant,
as given by Eq. (14.10), becomes:
​​f ​ˆ​  C​​∕ ​f​  C° ​​

The second term arises from Eq. (14.35) applied to species C, Eq. (14.29) applied to B
with ​fB​ ​∕f​​  B°​ ​  = 1​, and the fact that ​​f​  A°​ ​ = ​P​​  °​​ for species A in the gas phase. Because K depends on
the standard states, this value of K differs from that which would arise from other choices of
standard states. However, other choices of standard states would still lead to the same equilibrium composition, provided Henry’s law as applied to species C in solution is valid. In practice, a particular choice of standard states may simplify calculations or yield more accurate
results because it makes better use of available data. The nature of the calculations required for
heterogeneous reactions is illustrated in the following example.

Example 14.10
Estimate the compositions of the liquid and vapor phases when ethylene reacts with
water to form ethanol at 200°C and 34.5 bar, conditions that assure the presence of
both liquid and vapor phases. The reaction vessel is maintained at 34.5 bar by connection to a source of ethylene at this pressure. Assume no other reactions.

Solution 14.10
According to the phase rule (Sec. 14.8), the system has two degrees of freedom.
Specification of both T and P therefore fixes the intensive state of the system,
independent of the initial amounts of reactants. Material-balance equations are
irrelevant, and we can make no use of equations that relate compositions to the
reaction coordinate. Instead, phase-equilibrium relations must provide a sufficient
number of equations to allow solution for the unknown compositions.
The most convenient approach to this problem is to regard the chemical reaction as occurring in the vapor phase. Thus,
	​
​C​2​  H​4​(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → ​C​2​  H​5​OH(g)​
and the standard states are those of the pure ideal gases at 1 bar. For these standard
states, the equilibrium expression is Eq. (14.25), which in this case becomes:

K = ​ ________ ​ ​P​​  °​​

where the standard-state pressure P° is 1 bar (expressed in appropriate units). A

For 200°C (473.15 K), this equation yields:
	​
ln K = −3.473   K = 0.0310​

14.7. Equilibrium Conversions for Single Reactions
The task now is to incorporate the phase-equilibrium equations, ​​​fˆ​​  vi​  ​= ​​fˆ​​    il​  ​​, into
Eq. (A) and to relate the fugacities to the compositions in such a way that the equations can be readily solved. Equation (A) may be written:

The fugacity ​f​​il​​​is for pure liquid i at the temperature and pressure of the system. However, pressure has small effect on the fugacity of a liquid, and to a good

VLE measurements, are given by Otsuki and Williams.8 From their results for the
ethanol/water system, one can estimate values of  ​​γ​​H​2​O​​ and γEtOH at 200°C. (Pressure has little effect on the activity coefficients of liquids.)
A procedure for solution of the foregoing three equations is as follows:
1. Assume a value for xEtOH and calculate ​x​​H​2​O​by Eq. (K).
2. Determine  ​​γ​​H​2​O​​ and γEtOH from data in the reference cited.
3. Calculate y​​ ​  ​C​2​H​4​​​​ by Eq. (M).
4. Calculate K by Eq. (L) and compare with the value of 0.0310 determined from

5. If the two values agree, the assumed value of xEtOH is correct. If they do not agree,
assume a new value of xEtOH and repeat the procedure.

If xEtOH = 0.06, then by Eq. (K), ​x​​H​2​O​= 0.94, and from the reference cited,
	​
​γ​EtOH​= 3.34   and   ​γ​​H​2​O​= 1.00​
By Eq. (M),

​y​​C​2​H​4​​ = 1 − (0.907)(3.34)(0.06) − (0.493)(1.00)(0.94) = 0.355​

This result is in close enough agreement with the value, 0.0310, found from

14.8 PHASE RULE AND DUHEM’S THEOREM FOR
REACTING SYSTEMS
The phase rule (applicable to intensive properties) as discussed in Secs. 3.1 and 12.2 for nonreacting systems of π phases and N chemical species is:
	​
F = 2 − π + N​
It must be modified for application to systems in which chemical reactions occur. The phaserule variables are unchanged: temperature, pressure, and N − 1 mole fractions in each phase.
The total number of these variables is 2 + (N − 1)(π). The same phase-equilibrium equations apply as before, and they number (π − 1)(N). However, Eq. (14.8) provides for each
independent reaction an additional relation that must be satisfied at equilibrium. Because the
µi’s are functions of temperature, pressure, and the phase compositions, Eq. (14.8) represents
a relation connecting phase-rule variables. If there are r independent chemical reactions at
equilibrium within the system, then there is a total of (π − 1)(N) + r independent equations

556

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

relating the phase-rule variables. Taking the difference between the number of variables and
the number of equations gives:
	​
F = [2 + (N − 1)(π)] − [(π − 1)(N  ) + r]​
or	​
​F = 2 − π + N − r​​

(14.36)

This is the phase rule for reacting systems.
The only remaining problem for application is to determine the number of independent
chemical reactions. This can be done systematically as follows:
∙ Write chemical equations for the formation, from the constituent elements, of each
chemical compound considered present in the system.
∙ Combine these equations so as to eliminate from them all elements not considered present as elements in the system. A systematic procedure is to select one equation and
combine it with each of the others of the set to eliminate a particular element. Then the
process is repeated to eliminate another element from the new set of equations. This is
done for each element eliminated [see Ex. 14.11(d)], and it usually reduces the set by
one equation for each element eliminated. However, the simultaneous elimination of two
or more elements may occur.
The set of r equations resulting from this reduction procedure is a complete set of independent reactions for the N species considered present in the system. More than one such set
is possible, depending on how the reduction procedure is carried out, but all sets number r and
are equivalent. The reduction procedure also ensures the following relation:
​r ≥ number of compounds present in the system
− number of constituent elements not present as elements​
The phase-equilibrium and chemical-reaction-equilibrium equations are the only ones
considered in the foregoing treatment as interrelating the phase-rule variables. However, in
certain situations special constraints may be placed on the system that allow additional equations to be written over and above those considered in the development of Eq. (14.36). If the
number of equations resulting from special constraints is s, then Eq. (14.36) must be modified
to take account of these s additional equations. The still more general form of the phase rule
that results is:
	​
​F = 2 − π + N − r − s​​

(14.37)

Example 14.11 shows how Eqs. (14.36) and (14.37) may be applied to specific systems.

Example 14.11
Determine the number of degrees of freedom F for each of the following systems.
(a) A system of two miscible nonreacting species that exists as an azeotrope in
vapor/liquid equilibrium.

14.8. Phase Rule and Duhem’s Theorem for Reacting Systems

557

(b) A system prepared by partially decomposing CaCO3 into an evacuated
space.
(c) A system prepared by partially decomposing NH4Cl into an evacuated space.
(d) A system consisting of the gases CO, CO2, H2, H2O, and CH4 in chemical
equilibrium.

Solution 14.11
(a) The system consists of two nonreacting species in two phases. If there were no
azeotrope, Eq. (14.36) would apply:
	​
F = 2 − π + N − r = 2 − 2 + 2 − 0 = 2​
This is the usual result for binary VLE. However, a special constraint is imposed
on the system; it is an azeotrope. This provides an equation, x1 = y1, not considered in the development of Eq. (14.36). Thus, Eq. (14.37) with s = 1 yields
F = 1. If the system is an azeotrope, then just one phase-rule variable—T, P, or
x1 (= y1)—may be arbitrarily specified.
(b) Here, a single chemical reaction occurs:
	​
​CaCO​3​(​s​)​→ CaO​(​s​)​+ ​CO​2​(​g​)​​
and r = 1. Three chemical species are present, and three phases: solid CaCO3, solid
CaO, and gaseous CO2. One might think a special constraint has been imposed by
the requirement that the system be prepared in a special way—by decomposing
CaCO3. This is not the case, because no equation connecting the phase-rule variables can be written as a result of this requirement. Therefore,
	​
F = 2 − π + N − r − s = 2 − 3 + 3 − 1 − 0 = 1​
and there is a single degree of freedom. Thus, CaCO3 exerts a fixed decomposition pressure at fixed T.
(c) The chemical reaction here is:
	​
​NH​4​Cl​(​s​)​→ ​NH​3​(​g​)​+ HCl​(​g​)​​
Three species, but only two phases, are present in this case: solid NH4Cl and
a gas mixture of NH3 and HCl. In addition, a special constraint is imposed by
the requirement that the system be formed by the decomposition of NH4Cl. This
means that the gas phase is equimolar in NH3 and HCl. Thus a special equation, ​
y​​NH​3​​​= yHCl (= 0.5), connecting the phase-rule variables can be written. Application of Eq. (14.37) gives:
	​
F = 2 − π + N − r − s = 2 − 2 + 3 − 1 − 1 = 1​

558

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria
and the system has but one degree of freedom. This result is the same as that for
part (b), and it is a matter of experience that NH4Cl has a given decomposition
pressure at a given temperature. This conclusion is reached quite differently in the
two cases.
(d) This system contains five species, all in a single gas phase. There are no special constraints. Only r remains to be determined. The formation reactions for the
compounds present are:
​C + ​ _12 ​​O​2​→ CO​

(A)

​C + ​O​2​→ ​CO​2​

(B)

​H​2​+ ​ _12 ​​O​2​→ ​H​2​O​

(C)

​C + 2​H​2​→ ​CH​4​

(D)

Systematic elimination of C and O2, the elements not present in the system, leads
to two equations. One such pair of equations is obtained in the following way.
Eliminate C from the set of equations by combining Eq. (B), first with Eq. (A) and
then with Eq. (D). The two resulting reactions are:
	​
From (B) and (A): CO + _​  12 ​​O​2​→ ​CO​2​​

(E)

	​
From (B) and (D): C​H​4​+ ​O​2​→ 2​H​2​+ ​CO​2​​

(F)

Equations (C ), (E), and (F ) are the new set, and we now eliminate O2 by combining Eq. (C ), first with Eq. (E) and then with Eq. (F ). This gives:
	​
From (C) and (E ): C​O​2​+ ​H​2​→ CO + ​H​2​O​

(G)

	​
From (C) and (F ): C​H​4​+ 2​H​2​O → C​O​2​+ 4​H​2​​

(H)

Equations (G) and (H) are an independent set and indicate that r = 2. The use of
different elimination procedures produces other pairs of equations, but always just
two equations.
Application of Eq. (14.37) yields:
	​
F = 2 − π + N − r − s = 2 − 1 + 5 − 2 − 0 = 4​
This result means that one is free to specify four phase-rule variables, for example,
T, P, and two mole fractions, in an equilibrium mixture of these five chemical
species, provided that nothing else is arbitrarily set. In other words, there can be
no special constraints, such as the specification that the system be prepared from
given amounts of CH4 and H2O. This imposes special constraints through material
balances that reduce the degrees of freedom to two. (Duhem’s theorem; see the
following paragraphs.)
Duhem’s theorem for nonreacting systems was developed in Sec. 12.2. It states that
for any closed system formed initially from given masses of particular chemical species, the

559

14.9. Multireaction Equilibria

equilibrium state is completely determined (extensive as well as intensive properties) by specification of any two independent variables. This theorem gives the difference between the number of independent variables that completely determine the state of the system and the number
of independent equations that can be written connecting these variables:
	​
[2 + (N − 1)(π) + π] − [(π − 1)(N  ) + N] = 2​
When chemical reactions occur, a new variable εj is introduced into the material-balance equations for each independent reaction. Furthermore, a new equilibrium relation [Eq. (14.8)] can
be written for each independent reaction. Therefore, when chemical-reaction equilibrium is
superimposed on phase equilibrium, r new variables appear and r new equations can be written. The difference between the number of variables and the number of equations therefore is
unchanged, and Duhem’s theorem as originally stated holds for reacting systems as well as for
nonreacting systems.
Most chemical-reaction equilibrium problems are posed such that Duhem’s theorem
makes them determinate. The usual problem is to find the composition of a system that reaches
equilibrium from an initial state of fixed amounts of reacting species when the two variables
T and P are specified.

14.9

MULTIREACTION EQUILIBRIA

When the equilibrium state in a reacting system depends on two or more independent chemical reactions, the equilibrium composition can be found by a direct extension of the methods
developed for single reactions. One first determines a set of independent reactions as discussed in Sec. 14.8. With each independent reaction there is associated a reaction coordinate
in accord with the treatment of Sec. 14.1. In addition, a separate equilibrium constant is evaluated for each reaction j, and Eq. (14.10) becomes:
​ν​  ​​

i, j

(14.40)

For r independent reactions there are r separate equations of this kind, and the {yi} can be
eliminated by Eq. (14.7) in favor of the r reaction coordinates εj. The set of equations is then
solved simultaneously for the r reaction coordinates, as illustrated in the following examples.

560

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

Example 14.12
A feedstock of pure n-butane is cracked at 750 K and 1.2 bar to produce olefins. Only
two reactions have favorable equilibrium conversions at these conditions:
​C​4​H​10​→ ​C​2​H​4​+ ​C​2​H​6​​  (I)
​C​4​H​10​→ ​C​3​H​6​+ C​H​4​​  

(II)

If these reactions reach equilibrium, what is the product composition?
With data from App. C and procedures illustrated in Ex. 14.4, the equilibrium constants at 750 K are found to be:
​K​I​= 3.856   and   ​K​II​= 268.4​

Solution 14.12

For this simple reaction scheme, analytical solution is possible. However, this is
unusual. In most cases the solution of multireaction-equilibrium problems requires
numerical techniques.

Example 14.13
A bed of coal (assumed to be pure carbon) in a coal gasifier is fed with steam and air
and produces a gas stream containing H2, CO, O2, H2O, CO2, and N2. If the feed to the

containing:
	​
​O​2​: (0.21)(2.38) = 0.5 mol   ​N​2​: (0.79)(2.38) = 1.88 mol​
The species present at equilibrium are C, H2, CO, O2, H2O, CO2, and N2. The
formation reactions for the compounds present are:

Because the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon are themselves presumed to
be present in the system, this set of three independent reactions is a complete set.
All species are present as gases except carbon, which is a pure solid phase. In
the equilibrium expression, Eq. (14.38), the fugacity ratio of the pure carbon, is ​
 ​​fˆ​​  C​​∕​f​  C° ​​ ​  = ​​fC​ ​​∕​​f​  C° ​,​  the fugacity of carbon at 20 bar divided by the fugacity of carbon
at 1 bar. Because the effect of pressure on the fugacity of a solid is very small,
negligible error is introduced by the assumption that this ratio is unity. The fugacity ratio for carbon is then f​​​ˆ​​  C​​∕f​ ​  C° ​​ ​  = 1, and it may be omitted from the equilibrium expression. With the assumption that the remaining species are ideal gases,
Eq. (14.40) is written for the gas phase only, and it provides the following equilibrium expressions for reactions (I) through (III):

With each Kj so large, the quantity 1 − εI − εII − 2εIII in the denominator of each
equilibrium equation must be nearly zero. This means that the mole fraction of
oxygen in the equilibrium mixture is very small. For practical purposes, no oxygen is present.
We therefore reformulate the problem by eliminating O2 from the formation
reactions. For this, Eq. (I) is combined, first with Eq. (II), and then with Eq. (III).
This provides two equations:
	​
C + ​CO​2​→ 2CO​       (a)
	​
​H​2​O + C → ​H​2​+ CO​  (b)

The input stream is specified to contain 1 mol H2, 0.5 mol O2, and 1.88 mol N2.
Because O2 has been eliminated from the set of reaction equations, we replace the
0.5 mol of O2 in the feed by 0.5 mol of CO2. The presumption is that this amount
of CO2 has been formed by prior reaction of the 0.5 mol O2 with carbon. Thus the
equivalent feed stream contains 1 mol H2, 0.5 mol CO2, and 1.88 mol N2, and the
application of Eq. (14.7) to Eqs. (a) and (b) gives:

We have here assumed a sufficient depth of coal so that the gases reach equilibrium while in contact with incandescent carbon. This need not be the case; if
oxygen and steam are supplied at too high a rate, the reactions may not attain equilibrium or may reach equilibrium after they have left the coal bed. In this event,
carbon is not present at equilibrium, and the problem must again be reformulated.

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

Although Eqs. (A) and (B) of the preceding example are readily solved, the method of
equilibrium constants does not lend itself to standardization that allows a general program
to be written for computer solution. An alternative criterion of equilibrium, mentioned in
Sec. 14.2, is based on the fact that at equilibrium the total Gibbs energy of the system has its
minimum value, as illustrated for a single reaction in Fig. 14.1. Applied to multiple reactions,
this criterion is the basis for a general scheme of computer solution of multiple reaction
equilibria.
The total Gibbs energy of a single-phase system as given by Eq. (10.2) shows that:
	​
​(​G​t​)​T, P​= g(​n​1​, ​n​2​, ​n​3​, . . . ​n​N​)​
The problem is to find the set {ni} that minimizes Gt for specified T and P, subject to the constraints of the material balances. The standard solution to this problem is based on the method
of Lagrange multipliers. The procedure for gas-phase reactions is as follows:
1. The first step is to formulate the constraining equations, i.e., the material balances.
Although reacting molecular species are not conserved in a closed system, the total
number of atoms of each element is constant. Let subscript k identify a particular atom.
Then define Ak as the total number of atomic masses of the kth element in the system,
as determined by the initial constitution of the system. Further, let aik be the number of
atoms of the kth element present in each molecule of chemical species i. The material
balance on each element k may then be written:
	​​​∑​ ​​n​i​​a​ik​= ​A​k​   (k = 1, 2, . . . , w​) ​
i

(14.41)

or	​
​∑​ ​​n​i​​a​ik​− ​A​k​= 0   (k = 1, 2, . . . , w)​
i

where w is the total number of distinct elements comprising the system.
2. Next, we introduce the Lagrange multipliers λk, one for each element, by multiplying
each element balance by its λk:
	​
​λ​k​ ​∑​ ​​n​i​​a​ik​− ​A​k​ ​= 0   (k = 1, 2, . . . , w)​
(i
)
These equations are summed over k, giving:
	​
​∑​ ​​λ​k​ ​∑​ ​​n​i​​a​ik​− ​A​k​ ​​  = 0
(i
)
k
3. Then a new function F is formed by addition of this last sum to Gt. Thus,
	​
F = ​G​t​+ ​∑​ ​​λ​k​ ​∑​ ​​n​i​​a​ik​− ​A​k​ ​​
(i
)
k
This new function is identical to Gt because the summation term is zero. However, the
partial derivatives of F and Gt with respect to ni are different, because the function F
incorporates the constraints of the material balances.

567

14.9. Multireaction Equilibria

4. The minimum value of F (and Gt) occurs when all of the partial derivatives (∂F∕∂ni)T, P, ​n​j​
are zero. We therefore differentiate the preceding equation, and set the resulting derivative equal to zero:
∂F

​​ + ​∑​ ​​λ​k​​a​ik​= 0   ​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N  )​​

T,  P,  ​n​j​

Because the first term on the right is the definition of the chemical potential [see Eq. (10.1)],
this equation can be written:
	​
​μ​i​+ ​∑​ ​​λ​k​​a​ik​= 0   (i = 1, 2, . . . , N  )​
k

(14.42)

The chemical potential is expressed in terms of fugacity by Eq. (14.9):
	​
​μ​i​= ​G​  i°​  ​+ RT ln(    ​​f ​ˆ​  i​​ ∕​f​  i°​  ​)​
For gas-phase reactions and standard states as the pure ideal gases at 1 bar:
	​
​μ​i​= ​G​  i°​  ​+ RT ln(​    ​f ​ˆ​  i​​  ∕P
​ ​​  °​)​
If ​​G​  i°​  ​​is arbitrarily set equal to zero for all elements in their standard states, then for
compounds ​​G​  i°​  ​ = Δ​G​  ​f°i​​ ​​​   , the standard Gibbs-energy change of formation for species i. In
addition, the fugacity is eliminated in favor of the fugacity coefficient by Eq. (10.52),
​​fˆ​i​= ​y​i​​ϕˆ​i     P​. With these substitutions, the equation for µi becomes:

​y​​​​ϕˆ​​  ​​ P
	​​​μ​i​= Δ​G​  ​f°i​​ ​​+ RT ln​ ​_____
​  i °i  ​
​ ​​​
( ​P​​  ​ )
Combination with Eq. (14.42) gives:

​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​ P
	​​Δ​G​  ​f°i​​​ ​+ RT ln​ ​_____
​  ° ​
​ ​+ ​∑​ ​​λ​ ​  a​ ​= 0   ​(i = 1, 2, . . . , N  )​​​
( ​P​ ​ ) k k ik

(14.43)

Note that P° is 1 bar, expressed in the units used for pressure. If species i is an element,​
Δ​G​  ​f°i​​ ​​​ is zero.
Equation (14.43) represents N equilibrium equations, one for each chemical species, and
Eq. (14.41) represents w material-balance equations, one for each element—a total of
N + w equations. The unknowns are the {ni} (note that yi = ni  ∕∑i ni), of which there are
N, and the {λk}, of which there are w—a total of N + w unknowns. Thus the number of
equations is sufficient for the determination of all unknowns.
The foregoing discussion has presumed that each ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​is known. If the phase is an ideal
gas, then for each species ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​ = 1. If the phase is an ideal solution, ϕ
​​​ˆ​​  i​​​ = ​ϕi​​, and values can at
least be estimated. For real gases, ​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​​is a function of the {yi}, which are being calculated.
Thus an iterative procedure is indicated. The calculations are initiated with ϕ
​​​ˆ​​  i​​​ = 1 for all i.
Solution of the equations then provides a preliminary set of {yi}. For low pressures or high
temperatures this result is usually adequate. Where it is not satisfactory, an equation of state is
used together with the calculated {yi} to give a new and more nearly correct set ​{ ​​ϕˆ​​  i​​}​ for use

568

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

in Eq. (14.43). Then a new set of {yi} is determined. The process is repeated until successive
iterations produce no significant change in {yi}. All calculations are well suited to computer
solution, including the calculation of {​ ​​ϕˆ​​  i​​}​by equations such as Eq. (10.64).
In the procedure just described, the question of what chemical reactions are involved
never enters directly into any of the equations. However, the choice of a set of species is
entirely equivalent to the choice of a set of independent reactions among the species. In any
event, a set of species or an equivalent set of independent reactions must always be assumed,
and different assumptions produce different results.

Example 14.14
Calculate the equilibrium compositions at 1000 K and 1 bar of a gas-phase system
containing the species CH4, H2O, CO, CO2, and H2. In the initial unreacted state there
are present 2 mol of CH4 and 3 mol of H2O. Values of Δ
​ ​G​  °​f​ ​​i​​  at 1000 K are:
Δ​G​  °​f​​CH​4​​​ = 19,720 ​J·mol​​−1​

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

FUEL CELLS

A fuel cell is a device in which a fuel is oxidized electrochemically to produce electric power. It
has some characteristics of a battery, in that it consists of two electrodes, separated by an electrolyte. However, the reactants are not stored in the cell but are fed to it continuously, and the
products of reaction are continuously withdrawn. The fuel cell is thus not given an initial electric charge, and in operation it does not lose electric charge. It operates as a c­ ontinuous-flow
system as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied, and it produces a steady electric current. Compared to the conventional process of burning a fuel and extracting mechanical work via a heat
engine to power a generator, fuel cells provide a more efficient means of converting the chemical energy available by oxidation of fuels into electrical energy. In the context of the present
chapter, they provide an interesting example of chemical reaction equilibrium influenced by
an external constraint—the electrical circuit driven by the fuel cell.
In a fuel cell, the fuel, e.g., hydrogen, methane, butane, methanol, etc., makes intimate
contact with an anode or fuel electrode, and oxygen (usually in air) makes intimate contact
with a cathode or oxygen electrode. Half-cell reactions occur at each electrode, and their sum
is the overall reaction. Several types of fuel cell exist, each characterized by a particular type
of electrolyte.10
Cells operating with hydrogen as the fuel are the simplest such devices, and they serve
to illustrate basic principles. Schematic diagrams of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells appear in
Fig. 14.6. When the electrolyte is acidic [Fig. 14.6(a)], the half-cell reaction occurring at the
hydrogen electrode (anode) is:
	​
​H​2​→ 2​H​+​+ 2​e​−​​
and that at the oxygen electrode (cathode) is:
	​​ _12 ​ ​O​2​+ 2​e​−​+ 2​H​+​→ ​H​2​O(g)​
When the electrolyte is alkaline [Fig. 14.6(b)], the half-cell reaction at the anode is:
	​
​H​2​+ 2​OH​​−​→ 2​H​2​O(g) + 2​e​−​​
and at the cathode:
	​​ _12 ​ ​O​2​+ 2​e​−​+ ​H​2​O(g) → 2​OH​​−​​
In either case, the sum of the half-cell reactions is the overall reaction of the cell:
	​
​H​2​+ _​  12 ​ O​​2​→ ​H​2​O(g)​
This of course is the combustion reaction of hydrogen, but combustion in the conventional
sense of burning does not occur in the cell.
In both cells electrons with negative charge (e−) are released at the anode, produce an
electric current in an external circuit, and are taken up by the reaction occurring at the cathode.
The electrolyte does not allow the passage of electrons, but it provides a path for migration
10Construction details of the various types of fuel cells and extensive explanations of their operation are given
by J. Larminie and A. Dicks, Fuel Cell Systems Explained, 2nd ed., Wiley, 2003. See also R. O’Hayre, S.-W. Cha,

For many practical applications the most satisfactory hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell is built
around a solid polymer that serves as an acid electrolyte. Because it is very thin and conducts
H+ ions or protons, it is known as a proton-exchange membrane. Each side of the membrane
is bonded to a porous electrode loaded with an electrocatalyst such as finely divided platinum.
The porous electrodes provide a very large surface area for reaction and accommodate the
diffusion of hydrogen and oxygen into the cell and water vapor out of the cell. Cells can be
stacked and connected in series to make very compact units with a desired terminal emf. They
typically operate at temperatures near 60°C.

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria
Because fuel-cell operation is a steady-flow process, the first law takes the form:

	​
ΔH = Q + ​W​elect​​
where potential- and kinetic-energy terms are omitted as negligible and shaft work has been
replaced by electrical work. If the cell operates reversibly and isothermally,
	​
Q = TΔS   and   ΔH = TΔS + ​W​elect​​
The electrical work of a reversible cell is therefore:
	​
​W​elect​= ΔH − TΔS = ΔG​

(14.44)

where Δ denotes a property change of reaction. The heat transfer to the surroundings required
for isothermal operation is:
	​
Q = ΔH − ΔG​

(14.45)

With reference to Fig. 14.6(a), we note that for each molecule of hydrogen consumed, two
electrons pass to the external circuit. On the basis of 1 mol of H2, the charge (q) transferred
between electrodes is:
	​
q = 2​N​A​(−e) coulomb​
where −e is the charge on each electron and NA is Avogadro’s number. Because the product
NAe is Faraday’s constant F, q = −2F.11 The electrical work is then the product of the charge
transferred and the emf (E, expressed in volts) of the cell:
	​
​W​elect​= −2FE joule​
The emf of a reversible cell is therefore:
−​W​elect​ _____
−ΔG
	​

(14.46)

These equations may be applied to a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell operating at 25°C and
1 bar with pure H2 and pure O2 as reactants and pure H2O vapor as product. If these species
are assumed to be ideal gases, then the reaction occurring is the standard formation reaction
for H2O(g) at 298.15 K, for which values from Table C.4 are:

	​
​W​elect​= −228,572 ​J·mol​​−1​   Q = −13,246 ​J·mol​​−1​   E = 1.184 volts​
If, as is more commonly the case, air is the source of oxygen, the cell receives O2 at
its partial pressure in air. Because the enthalpy of ideal gases is independent of pressure, the
enthalpy change of reaction for the cell is unchanged. However, the Gibbs-energy change of
reaction is affected. By Eq. (10.24),

​W​elect​= −226,638 ​J·mol​​−1​   Q = −15,180 ​J·mol​​−1​   E = 1.174 volts​
The use of air rather than pure oxygen does not significantly reduce the emf or work output of
a reversible cell.
The enthalpy and Gibbs-energy changes of reaction are given as functions of temperature by Eqs. (4.19) and (14.18). For a cell temperature of 60°C (333.15 K), the integrals in
these equations are evaluated as:

With cell operation at 1 bar and oxygen extracted from air, ​ΔH = Δ​H​  ​f°​333

	​
ΔG = −226,997 − ​(0.5)​(8.314)​(333.15)​(ln 0.21)​= −224,836 ​J·mol​​−1​​

	​
​W​elect​= −224,836 ​J·mol​​−1​   Q = −17,332 ​J·mol​​−1​   E = 1.165 volts​
Thus cell operation at 60°C rather than at 25°C reduces the voltage and work output of a
reversible cell by only a small amount.
These calculations for a reversible cell show that the electrical work output is more than
90% of the heat that would be released (ΔH) by actual combustion of the fuel. Were this heat
supplied to a Carnot engine operating at practical temperature levels, a much smaller fraction
would be converted into work. The reversible operation of a fuel cell implies that the external
circuit exactly balances its emf, with the result that its current output is negligible. In actual
operation under reasonable load, internal irreversibilities inevitably reduce the emf of the cell
and decrease its production of electrical work while increasing the amount of heat transfer to
the surroundings. The operating emf of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells is often 0.6–0.7 volts, and

574

CHAPTER 14. Chemical-Reaction Equilibria

the work output is closer to 50% of the heating value of the fuel. Nevertheless, the irreversibilities of a fuel cell are far less than those inherent in combustion of the fuel and production
of work by a practical heat engine. A fuel cell has the additional advantages of simplicity,
of clean and quiet operation, and of directly producing electrical energy. Fuels other than
hydrogen can also be used in fuel cells, but they require the development of effective catalysts.
Methanol, for example, reacts at the anode of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell according
to the equation:
	​
​CH​3​  OH + ​H​2​O → 6​H​+​+ 6​e​−​+ ​CO​2​​
The usual reaction of oxygen to form water vapor occurs at the cathode.

14.32. Hydrogen gas can be produced by the reaction of steam with “water gas,” an equimolar
mixture of H2 and CO obtained by the reaction of steam with coal. A stream of “water
gas” mixed with steam is passed over a catalyst to convert CO to CO2 by the reaction:
	​
​H​2​O​(​g​)​+ CO​(​g​)​→ ​H​2​(​g​)​+ ​CO​2​(​g​)​​
Subsequently, unreacted water is condensed and carbon dioxide is absorbed, leaving
a product that is mostly hydrogen. The equilibrium conditions are 1 bar and 800 K.
(a) Is any advantage gained by carrying out the reaction at pressures above 1 bar?
(b) Would increasing the equilibrium temperature increase the conversion of CO?
(c) For the given equilibrium conditions, determine the molar ratio of steam to “water
gas” (H2 + CO) required to produce a product gas containing only 2-mol-% CO
after cooling to 20°C, where the unreacted H2O has been virtually all condensed.
(d ) Is there any danger that solid carbon will form at the equilibrium conditions by the
reaction

​2CO​(​g​)​→ ​CO​2​(​g​)​+ C​(​s​)​​
14.33. The feed gas to a methanol synthesis reactor is composed of 75-mol-% H2, 15-mol-%
CO, 5-mol-% CO2, and 5-mol-% N2. The system comes to equilibrium at 550 K and
100 bar with respect to the reactions:
	​
2​H​2​(g)​+ CO​(g)​→ ​CH​3​  OH​(g)​   ​H​2​(g)​+ ​CO​2​(g)​→ CO​(g)​+ ​H​2​O​(g)​​
Assuming ideal gases, determine the composition of the equilibrium mixture.
14.34. “Synthesis gas” can be produced by the catalytic re-forming of methane with steam.
The reactions are:
	​
​CH​4​(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → CO(g) + 3​H​2​(g)    CO(g) + ​H​2​O(g) → ​CO​2​(g) + ​H​2​(g)​
Assume equilibrium is attained for both reactions at 1 bar and 1300 K.
(a) Would it be better to carry out the reaction at pressures above 1 bar?
(b) Would it be better to carry out the reaction at temperatures below 1300 K?
(c) Estimate the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas if
the feed consists of an equimolar mixture of steam and methane.
(d) Repeat part (c) for a steam-to-methane mole ratio in the feed of 2.
(e) How could the feed composition be altered to yield a lower ratio of hydrogen to
carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas than is obtained in part (c)?
(    f    ) Is there any danger that carbon will deposit by the reaction 2CO → C + CO2 under
conditions of part (c)? Part (d)? If so, how could the feed be altered to prevent
carbon deposition?

(a) Assuming ideal gases, develop from Eq. (14.28) the chemical-reaction equilibrium equation for the system.
(b) The result of part (a) should suggest that there is one degree of freedom for the
equilibrium state. Upon verifying that the phase rule indicates two degrees of freedom, explain the discrepancy.
14.36. A low-pressure, gas-phase isomerization reaction, A→B, occurs at conditions such
that vapor and liquid phases are present.
(a) Prove that the equilibrium state is univariant.
(b) Suppose T is specified. Show how to calculate xA, yA, and P. State carefully, and
justify, any assumptions.
14.37. Set up the equations required for solution of Ex. 14.14 by the method of equilibrium
constants. Verify that your equations yield the same equilibrium compositions as
given in the example.
14.38. Reaction-equilibrium calculations may be useful for estimation of the compositions
of hydrocarbon feedstocks. A particular feedstock, available as a low-pressure gas
at 500 K, is identified as “aromatic C8.” It could in principle contain the C8H10
isomers: o-xylene (OX), m-xylene (MX), p-xylene (PX), and ethylbenzene (EB).
Estimate how much of each species is present, assuming the gas mixture has come
to equilibrium at 500 K and low pressure. The following is a set of independent reactions (why?):
​OX → MX​

14.39. Ethylene oxide as a vapor and water as liquid, both at 25°C and 101.33 kPa, react to form
a liquid solution containing ethylene glycol (1,2-ethanediol) at the same conditions:
	​
​⟨​(​CH​2​)​2​⟩​O + ​H​2​O → ​CH​2​  OH.CH​2​  OH​​
If the initial molar ratio of ethylene oxide to water is 3.0, estimate the equilibrium
conversion of ethylene oxide to ethylene glycol.
At equilibrium the system consists of liquid and vapor in equilibrium, and the intensive state of the system is fixed by the specification of T and P. Therefore, one must
first determine the phase compositions, independent of the ratio of reactants. These
results may then be applied in the material-balance equations to find the equilibrium
conversion.
Choose as standard states for water and ethylene glycol the pure liquids at 1 bar and
for ethylene oxide the pure ideal gas at 1 bar. Assume any water present in the liquid
phase has an activity coefficient of unity and that the vapor phase is an ideal gas. The
partial pressure of ethylene oxide over the liquid phase is given by:
	​
​p​i​∕ kPa = 415 ​x​i​​
The vapor pressure of ethylene glycol at 25°C is so low that its concentration in the
vapor phase is negligible.
14.40. In chemical-reaction engineering, special measures of product distribution are sometimes used when multiple reactions occur. Two of these are yield Yj and selectivity Sj∕k.
We adopt the following definitions12:
moles formed of desired product j
________________________________________________
​Y​j​≡ ​     
      ​
moles of j that would be formed with no side reactions and
​     ​​
with complete
consumption of the limiting reactant
species ​
	​​
     
 ​​
moles formed of desired product j
​S​j∕k​≡ ______________________________
​   
   ​
moles formed of undesired product k
For any particular application, yield and selectivity can be related to component rates
and reaction coordinates. For two-reaction schemes the two reaction coordinates can
be found from Yj and Sj∕k, allowing the usual material-balance equations to be written.
Consider the gas-phase reactions:
	​
A + B → C  (I)      A + C → D  (II)​
Here, C is the desired product, and D is the undesired by-product. If the feed to a
steady-flow reactor contains 10 kmol·h−1 of A and 15 kmol·h−1 of B, and if YC = 0.40
and SC/D = 2.0, determine complete product rates and the product composition (mole
fractions), using reaction coordinates.

14.41. The following problems involving chemical-reaction stoichiometry are to be solved
through the use of reaction coordinates.
(a) Feed to a gas-phase reactor comprises 50 kmol·h−1 of species A, and 50 kmol·h−1
of species B. Two independent reactions occur:
	​
A + B → C   (I)      A + C → D  (II)​
Analysis of the gaseous effluent shows mole fractions yA = 0.05 and yB = 0.10.
(i) What is the reactor effluent rate in kmol·h−1 ?
(ii) What are the mole fractions yC and yD in the effluent?
(b) Feed to a gas-phase reactor comprises 40 kmol·h−1 of species A, and 40 kmol·h−1
of species B. Two independent reactions occur:
	​
A + B → C  (I)      A + 2B → D  (II)​
Analysis of the gaseous effluent shows mole fractions: yC = 0.52 and yD = 0.04.
Determine the rates (kmol·h−1) of all species in the effluent stream.
(c) Feed to a gas-phase reactor is 100 kmol·h−1 of pure species A. Two independent
reactions occur:
	​
A → B + C  (I)      A + B → D  (II)​
Reaction (I) produces valuable species C and coproduct B. The side reaction (II)
produces by-product D. Analysis of the gaseous effluent shows mole fractions
yC = 0.30 and yD = 0.10. Determine the rates (kmol·h−1) of all species in the
effluent stream.
(d) The feed to a gas-phase reactor is 100 kmol·h−1, containing 40 mol-% species A
and 60 mol-% species B. Two independent reactions occur:
	​

Analysis of the gaseous effluent shows mole fractions yC = 0.25 and yD = 0.20.
Determine:
(i) Rates in kmol·h−1 of all species in the effluent stream.
(ii) Mole fractions of all species in the effluent stream.
14.42. The following is an industrial-safety rule of thumb: compounds with large positive​

14.43. Two important classes of reactions are oxidation reactions and cracking reactions.
One class is invariably endothermic; the other, exothermic. Which is which? For
which class of reactions (oxidation or cracking) does equilibrium conversion increase
with increasing T  ?
14.44. The standard heat of reaction ΔH° for gas-phase reactions is independent of the choice
of standard-state pressure P°. (Why?) However, the numerical value of ΔG° for such

14.12. Problems

585

reactions does depend on P°. Two choices of P° are conventional: 1 bar (the basis
adopted in this text), and 1.01325 bar. Show how to convert ΔG° for gas-phase reactions from values based on P° = 1 bar to those based on P° = 1.01325 bar.
14.45. Ethanol is produced from ethylene via the gas-phase reaction
	​
​C​2​  H​4​(​g​)​+ ​H​2​O​(​g​)​→ ​C​2​  H​5​  OH​(​g​)​​
Reaction conditions are 400 K and 2 bar.

containing only ethylene and H2O. State all assumptions.
(d) For the same feed as in part (c), but for P = 1 bar, would the equilibrium mole
fraction of ethanol be higher or lower? Explain.
14.46. A good source for formation data for compounds is the NIST Chemistry WebBook
site. Values of ​ΔH
​ ​  f°​  ​​, but not of ​ΔG
​ ​  f°​  ​​, are reported. Instead, values of absolute standard
entropies S° are listed for compounds and elements. To illustrate the use of NIST data,
let H2O2 be the compound of interest. Values provided by the Chemistry WebBook are
as follows:
∙	​Δ​H​  f°​  ​​[H2O2(g)] = 136.1064 J·mol−1
∙ S°[H2O2(g)] = 232.95 J·mol−1·K−1
∙ S°[H2(g)] = 130.680 J·mol−1·K−1
∙ S°[O2(g)]= 205.152 J·mol−1·K−1
All data are for the ideal-gas state at 298.15 K and 1 bar. Determine a value of
​ΔG
​ ​  ​f°​298
 ​​​​for H2O2(g).
14.47. Reagent-grade, liquid-phase chemicals often contain as impurities isomers of the
nominal compound, with a consequent effect on the vapor pressure. This can be quantified by phase-equilibrium/reaction-equilibrium analysis. Consider a system containing isomers A and B in vapor/liquid equilibrium, and also in equilibrium with respect
to the reaction A → B at relatively low pressure.
(a) For the reaction in the liquid phase, determine an expression for P (the “mixture
vapor pressure”) in terms of P​ 
​​ Asat​  ​, ​PB​ sat​  ​​, and K l, the reaction equilibrium constant.
Check the result for the limits K l = 0 and K l = ∞.
(b) For the reaction in the vapor phase, repeat part (a). Here, the relevant reaction
equilibrium constant is K v.
(c) If equilibrium prevails, then whether the reaction is assumed to occur in one phase
or the other makes no difference. Thus the results for parts (a) and (b) must be
equivalent. Use this idea to show the connection between K l and K v through the
pure-species vapor pressures.

(d  ) Why is the assumption of ideal gases and ideal solutions both reasonable and
prudent?
(e) Results for parts (a) and (b) should suggest that P depends on T only. Show that
this is in accord with the phase rule.

14.48. Cracking propane is a route to light olefin production. Suppose that two cracking reactions occur in a steady-flow reactor:

Topics in Phase Equilibria

In chapters 12 and 13, we introduced phase equilibrium in general terms, but we focused
­primarily on vapor/liquid equilibrium. VLE has long been considered the most important type
of phase equilibrium for chemical engineers, due to the prevalence of distillation as a separation
method in the chemical industry. However, a wide variety of other phase equilibria are of
importance in chemical engineering. This chapter deals more generally with phase equilibria,
with consideration given in separate sections to liquid/liquid, vapor/liquid/liquid, solid/liquid,
solid/vapor, adsorption, and osmotic equilibria. In each case, we aim to provide a qualitative
introduction and a quantitative framework that is sufficient to begin to treat practical problems
and that provides a foundation for more specialized study of these topics.

15.1

LIQUID/LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM

The criteria for stability of a single liquid phase and the general features of liquid/liquid
equilibrium were introduced in Sec. 12.4. A key result from that section is the following
criterion of stability for a single-phase binary system for which the change in Gibbs energy
upon ­mixing is ​ΔG ≡ G − ​x​1​G​1​− ​x​2​G​2​:​
At fixed temperature and pressure, a single-phase binary mixture is stable if and only if ΔG and its first and second derivatives are continuous
functions of x1, and the second derivative is positive.
​d​2​ΔG
 ​ > 0​    (const T, P)​​
Thus,	​​​ ______
d​x2​1​​ 
​d​2(​​​ ΔG ∕ RT)​​
and	​​​ __________
 ​ > 0   (const T, P)​​	
d​x2​1​​ 

(12.4)

This criterion can be most readily applied in the context of an activity coefficient formulation
of the excess Gibbs energy. For a binary mixture Eq. (13.10) is:

Example 15.1
The stability criteria apply to a particular phase. However, there is nothing to preclude
their application to problems in phase equilibria, where the phase of interest (e.g., a
liquid mixture) is in equilibrium with another phase (e.g., a vapor mixture). Consider
binary isothermal vapor/liquid equilibria at pressures low enough that the vapor phase
may be considered an ideal-gas mixture. What are the implications of liquid-phase
­stability to the features of isothermal Pxy diagrams such as those in Fig. 12.8?

589

15.1. Liquid/Liquid Equilibrium

Focus initially on the liquid phase. By Eq. (15.2) applied to species 1,

Similarly, with Eq. (15.2) applied to species 2 and d​ ​x​2​= − d​x​1​​:
d ln ​ ​fˆ​​  ​​ 2​​
	​​ _____

Thus, Eq. (A) yields:

(B)

which is an essential feature of binary VLE. Note that, although P is not constant
for isothermal VLE, Eq. (A) is still approximately valid, because its application is
to the liquid phase, for which properties are insensitive to pressure.
The next part of this analysis draws on the fugacity form of the Gibbs/Duhem
equation, Eq. (13.27), applied again to the liquid phase:

CHAPTER 15. Topics in Phase Equilibria
Because by Eq. (B) ​d​y​1​∕ d​x​1​ > 0​, Eq. (C) asserts that the sign of ​dP ∕ d​x​1​ is the
same as the sign of the quantity ​y​1​− ​x​1​​.
The last part of this analysis is based only upon mathematics, according to
which, at constant T,

​(D)
d​y​1​ d​y​1​∕ d​x​1​
But by Eq. (B), ​d​y​1​∕ d​x​1​> 0​. Thus d​ P ∕ d​y​1​has the same sign as d​ P ∕ d ​x​1​.​
In summary, the stability requirement implies the following for VLE in binary
systems at constant temperature:
d​y​1​

Although derived for conditions of low pressure, these results are of general validity,
as illustrated by the VLE data shown in Fig. 12.8.

Many pairs of chemical species, were they to mix to form a single liquid phase in a
certain composition range, would not satisfy the stability criterion of Eq. (12.4). Such systems
therefore split in this composition range into two liquid phases of different compositions. If
the phases are at thermodynamic equilibrium, the phenomenon is an example of liquid/liquid
equilibrium (LLE), which is important for industrial operations such as solvent extraction.
The equilibrium criteria for LLE are the same as for VLE, namely, uniformity of T, P,
and of the fugacity f​​ ​​​ˆ ​​ i​​​for each chemical species throughout both phases. For LLE in a system
of N species at uniform T and P, we denote the liquid phases by superscripts α and β, and we
write the equilibrium criteria as:
​​fˆ ​​ ​​  iα​  ​= ​​fˆ ​​ ​​  iβ​  ​

​  (i = 1, 2, . . . . , N )​​

With the introduction of activity coefficients, this becomes:
β β β

	​​x​iα​  ​​γ​iα​  ​​f​iα​  ​= ​x​i​  ​​γ​i​  ​​f​i​  ​​
β

If each pure species exists as liquid at the system temperature, ​​f​iα​  ​= ​f​i​  ​= ​fi​​​; whence,
β β
	​​​x​iα​  ​​γ​iα​  ​= ​x​i​  ​​γ​i​  ​  (i = 1, 2, . . . , N)​​

(15.4)

β

In Eq. (15.4), activity coefficients ​​γ​iα​  ​​ and γ​​ ​i​  ​​are derived from the same function ​G​E​∕ RT​;
thus they are functionally identical, distinguished mathematically only by the mole fractions to
which they apply. For a liquid/liquid system containing N chemical species:

15.1. Liquid/Liquid Equilibrium

According to Eqs. (15.4) and (15.5), N equilibrium equations can be written in 2N intensive
variables (T, P, and N − 1 independent mole fractions for each phase). Solution of the equilibrium equations for LLE therefore requires prior specification of numerical values for
N of the intensive variables. This is in accord with the phase rule, Eq. (3.1), from which​
F = 2 − π + N = 2 − 2 + N = N​. The same result is obtained for VLE with no special constraints on the equilibrium state.
In the general description of LLE, any number of species may be considered, and
pressure may be a significant variable. We treat here a simpler (but important) special case,
that of binary LLE either at constant pressure or at conditions at which the effect of pressure
on the activity coefficients may be ignored. With but one independent mole fraction per phase,
Eq. (15.4) gives:

With two equations and three variables (​​x​1α​  ​, ​x​1​  ​​, and T), fixing one of the variables allows
solution of Eq. (15.6) for the remaining two. Because ln γi, rather than γi, is a more natural
thermodynamic function, application of Eq. (15.6) often proceeds from the rearrangements:

γ​​ ​1α​  ​= ​γ​2​  ​= ∞​
Strictly speaking, no two liquids are completely immiscible. However, actual solubilities may be so small (e.g., for some hydrocarbon/water systems) that the idealβ

(Ex. 15.7).

15.1. Liquid/Liquid Equilibrium
β

Given a value of parameter A, one finds equilibrium compositions ​​x​1α​  ​​ and x​​ ​1​  ​​as the
solution to Eqs. (B) and (C).
Solubility curves implied by Eq. (A) are symmetrical about ​x​1​= 0.5​. This can
β
be inferred from the fact that ​​x​1α​  ​​ and ​​x​1​  ​​appear in exactly the same form in Eqs. (B)
and (C). This symmetry can be expressed by the relationship
β

	​​x​1​  ​= 1 − ​x​1α​  ​​(D)
Substituting Eq. (D) into Eqs. (B) and (C) reduces them both to the same equation:
1 − ​x​1​
	​
A​(1 − 2​x​1​)​= ln _____
​
​(E)
​x​1​
This implies that the inferred symmetry about ​x​1​= 0.5​is correct. When ​A > 2​, this
equation has three real roots: ​x​1​= 1 ∕ 2​, ​​x​1​= r​, and ​x​1​= 1 − r​, where 0​ < r < 1 ∕ 2​.
β
The latter two roots are the equilibrium compositions (​​
x​1α​  ​​ and ​​x​1​  ​​), whereas
the first root is a trivial solution. For A
​ < 2​only the trivial solution exists; the
value ​A = 2​corresponds to a consolute point, where the three roots converge to
the value 0.5. Table 15.1 shows values of A as calculated from Eq. (E) for various
β
values of x​
​​ 1α​  ​ (= 1 − x​ ​1​  ​)​. Note particularly the sensitivity of x​
​​ 1α​  ​​to small increases
in A from its limiting value of 2.

The actual shape of a solubility curve is determined by the temperature d­ ependence
of ​G​E​∕ RT​. Assume the following T dependence of parameter A in Eq. (A):

Thus ​dA ∕ dT​is negative for an endothermic system (positive HE) and positive for
an exothermic system (negative HE). A negative value of ​dA ∕ dT​at a consolute
point implies a UCST because A decreases to 2.0 as T increases. Conversely, a
positive value implies an LCST because A decreases to 2.0 as T decreases. Hence
a system described by Eqs. (A) and (F) exhibits a UCST if endothermic at the
consolute point and an LCST if exothermic at the consolute point. Equation (F)
written for a consolute point (​A = 2​) becomes:

Depending on the values of a, b, and c, this equation has zero, one, or two temperature roots.
Consider hypothetical binary systems described by Eqs. (A) and (F) and for
which LLE obtains in the temperature range 250 to 450 K. Setting c​ = 3.0​	 makes
the excess heat capacity positive, independent of T, for which by Eq. (H) the maximum value (at ​x​1​= ​x​2​= 0.5​) is 6.24 J mol−1 K−1. For the first case, let
− 975
	​
A = _____
​
​+ 22.4 − 3 ln T​
T
Here, Eq. (I) has two roots, corresponding to an LCST and a UCST:
and
	​
​T​L​= 272.9​

​ ​T​U​= 391.2 K​​

Values of A are plotted vs. T in Fig. 15.1(a) and the solubility curve [from Eq. (E)]
is shown by Fig. 15.1(b). This case—that of a closed solubility loop—is of the
type shown by Fig. 12.14(a). It requires that HE change sign in the temperature
interval for which LLE is possible.
As a second case, let

A = _____

T
Here, Eq. (I) has only one root in the temperature range 250 to 450 K. It is a
UCST, ​T​U​= 346.0​K, because Eq. (G) yields positive HE at this temperature. Values of A and the corresponding solubility curve are given by Fig. 15.2.

This case is similar to the second, there being only one T (339.7 K) that solves
Eq. (I) for the temperature range considered. However, this is a LCST, because HE
is now negative. Values of A and the solubility curve are shown in Fig. 15.3.
Example 15.3 demonstrates in a “brute-force” way that LLE cannot be predicted by the
expression ​G​E​∕ RT = A ​x​1​​x​2​for values of A
​ < 2​. If the goal is merely to determine under what
conditions LLE can occur, but not to find the compositions of the coexisting phases, then one
may instead invoke the stability criteria of Sec. 12.4 and determine under what conditions they
are satisfied.

Example 15.4
If ​G​E​∕ RT = A​x​1​​x​2​for a liquid phase, show by stability analysis that LLE is predicted for​
A ≥ 2​.

Solution 15.4
Application of the stability criterion requires evaluation of the derivative:

Thus, stability requires:	​

​​
​x​1​​x​2​
When ​x​1​= ​x​2​= 1 ∕ 2​, the right side of this inequality has its minimum value of 4;
thus ​A < 2​yields stability of single-phase mixtures over the entire composition
range. Conversely, if ​A > 2​, then binary mixtures described by ​G​E​∕ RT = A ​x​1​​x​2​​
form two liquid phases over some part of the composition range.

Example 15.5
Some expressions for ​G​E​∕ RT​are incapable of representing LLE. An example is the Wilson equation:
​G​E​

	​
​ ​= − ​x​1​ln ​( ​x​1​+ ​x​2​​Λ​12​)​− ​x​2​ln ​( ​x​2​+ ​x​1​​Λ​21​)​(13.45)

Show that the stability criteria are satisfied for all values of Λ12, Λ21, and x1.

All quantities on the right side of this equation are positive, and therefore Eq. (A)
is satisfied for all x1 and for all nonzero Λ12 and Λ21.1 Thus inequality (15.1) is
always satisfied, and LLE cannot be represented by the Wilson equation.

VAPOR/LIQUID/LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM (VLLE)

As noted in Sec. 12.4, the binodal curves representing LLE can intersect the VLE bubblepoint
curve. This gives rise to the phenomenon of vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium (VLLE), as illustrated in Fig. 12.15 though 12.18. For a binary system with three phases in equilibrium, the
phase rule tells us that only one degree of freedom remains. Thus, at a given T, two binary

CHAPTER 15. Topics in Phase Equilibria

liquid phases in equilibrium have a fixed vapor pressure, and at a given P, they have a fixed
boiling point temperature.
The compositions of the vapor and liquid phases in equilibrium for partially miscible systems are calculated in the same way as for miscible systems. In the regions where a
single liquid is in equilibrium with its vapor, VLE calculations are done as in Chapter 13.
Because limited miscibility implies highly nonideal behavior, any general assumption of
liquid-phase ideality is excluded. Even a combination of Henry’s law, valid for a species at
infinite dilution, and Raoult’s law, valid for a species as it approaches purity, is not very useful,
because each approximates actual behavior for only a very small composition range. Thus GE
is large, and its composition dependence is often not adequately represented by simple equations. Nevertheless, the NRTL and UNIQUAC equations and the UNIFAC method (App. G)
often provide suitable correlations for activity coefficients.

Example 15.6
Careful equilibrium measurements for the diethyl ether(1)/water(2) system at 35°C
have been reported.2 Discuss the correlation and behavior of the phase-equilibrium
data for this system.

Solution 15.6
The Pxy behavior of this system is shown by Fig. 15.4, where the very rapid rise in
pressure with increasing liquid-phase ether concentration in the dilute-ether region
is apparent. The three-phase pressure, ​P​*​= 104.6 kPa​, is reached at an ether mole
fraction of only 0.0117. Here, y1 also increases very rapidly to its three-phase
value of y​
​​ 1*​  ​ = 0.946​. In the dilute-water region, on the other hand, rates of change
are quite small, as shown to an expanded scale in Fig. 15.4(b).
The curves in Fig. 15.4 provide an excellent correlation of the VLE data. They
result from BUBL P calculations carried out with the excess Gibbs energy and
activity coefficients from a four-parameter modified Margules equation:

For the diethyl ether(l)/water(2) system at 35°C (Ex. 15.6), the correlation for ​G​E​∕ RT​ provides the values:
	​​​γ​1β​  ​= 1.0095

​  ​γ​2α​  ​= 1.0013​​	

These allow calculation of P* and y​

	​
​P​*​= ​(0.9500)​​(1.0095)​​(103.264)​+ ​(0.9883)​​(1.0013)​​(5.633)​= 104.6 kPa​

Although no two liquids are totally immiscible, this condition is so closely approached
in some instances that the assumption of complete immiscibility does not lead to appreciable
error. The phase characteristics of an immiscible system were illustrated by the temperature/
composition diagram of Fig. 12.18. Numerical calculations for immiscible systems are particularly simple, because of the following identities:
	​​​x​2α​  ​= 1  ​  ​γ​2α​  ​= 1  ​  ​x​1β​  ​= 1  ​  ​γ​1β​  ​= 1​​	
The three-phase-equilibrium pressure P* as given by Eq. (15.9) is therefore:

15.3 SOLID/LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM (SLE)
Phase behavior involving the solid and liquid states is the basis of important separation processes (e.g., crystallization) across many facets of chemical and materials engineering. Indeed,
a wide variety of binary phase behavior is observed for systems exhibiting solid/solid, solid/
liquid, and solid/solid/liquid equilibria. We develop here a rigorous formulation of solid/liquid
equilibrium (SLE), and we present as applications analyses of two limiting classes of behavior.
Comprehensive treatments can be found elsewhere.3
The basis for representing SLE is:
	​​​​f ​​ˆ​​  l​  ​= ​​f ​​ˆ​​  s​  ​​  (all i )​​	
i

i

where uniformity of T and P is understood. As with LLE, each ​​​f​​ ˆ ​​ i​​​is eliminated in favor of an
activity coefficient. Thus,
	​​​x​i​​γ​il​  ​​f​il​  ​= ​z​i​​γ​is​  ​​f​is​  ​​ 

(all i )​​	

where xi and zi are, respectively, the mole fractions of species i in the liquid and solid solutions. Equivalently,
	​​​x​i​​γ​il​  ​= ​z​i​​γ​is​  ​​ψ​i​​ 

(all i )​​

where	​
​ψ​i​≡ ​f​is​  ​∕ ​f​il​  ​​	

(15.11)
(15.12)

The right side of this equation, defining ψi as the ratio of fugacities at the T and P of the
system, may be written in expanded form:
​f​is​  ​​(​T​m
​ ​i​​, P)​ _________
​f​il​  ​​(​T​m

15.3. Solid/Liquid Equilibrium (SLE)

where Tmi is the melting temperature (“freezing point”) of pure species i, i.e., the temperature at
which pure-species SLE occurs. Thus the second ratio on the right side is unity because f​
​​ il​  ​= f​​is​  ​​
at the melting point of pure species i. Hence,

According to Eq. (15.13), evaluation of ψi requires expressions for the effect of temperature on fugacity. By Eq. (10.33), with ​ϕi​​= ​fi​​∕ P​,

(15.14)

Equation (15.14) is applied separately to the solid and liquid phases. The resulting expressions
are substituted into Eq. (15.13), which is then reduced by the identity:
ig

ig

	​
− (​H​iR,s

​  ​) = − [(​H​is​  ​− ​H​i​  ​) − (​H​il​  ​− ​H​i​  ​)] = ​H​il​  ​− ​H​is​  ​​	
This yields the exact expression:

In Eq. (15.17), ​Δ ​H​isl​  ​​is the enthalpy change of melting (“heat of fusion”) and ​Δ​C​  ​Psl​i ​​​ ​ is the
heat-capacity change of melting. Both quantities are evaluated at the melting temperature ​​​T​m
​ ​i​​​.​

Equations (15.11), (15.15), and (15.17) provide a formal basis for the solution of problems in solid/liquid equilibria. The full rigor of Eq. (15.17) is rarely maintained. For purposes
of development, pressure has been carried through as a thermodynamic variable. However,
its effect is rarely included in engineering applications. The triple integral represented by I is
a second-order contribution and is normally neglected. The heat-capacity change of melting
can be significant, but it is not always available; moreover, inclusion of the term involving
​ΔC
​ ​  ​Psl​i ​​​ ​ adds little to a qualitative understanding of SLE. With the assumptions that I and Δ
​ ​C​  ​Psl​i ​​​ ​
are negligible, Eqs. (15.15) and (15.17) together yield:

(15.18)

With ψi given by Eq. (15.18), all that is required for formulating an SLE problem is a set
of statements about the temperature and composition dependence of the activity coefficients​​
γ​il​  ​​ and γ​​ ​is​  ​​. In the general case, this requires algebraic expressions for GE(T, composition) for
both liquid and solid solutions. Consider two limiting special cases:
I. Assume ideal-solution behavior for both phases, i.e., let γ​
​​ il​  ​ = 1​ and ​​γ​is​  ​ = 1​for all T and
compositions.
II. Assume ideal-solution behavior for the liquid phase ​(​γ​il​  ​= 1)​, and complete immiscibility
for all species in the solid state (i.e., set ​z​i​​γ​is​  ​= 1​).
These two cases, restricted to binary systems, are considered in the following.
Case I
The two equilibrium equations which follow from Eq. (15.11) are:
​x​1​= ​z​1​​ψ​1​

(15.19a)

​x​2​= ​z​2​​ψ​2​

(15.19a)

where ψ1 and ψ2 are given by Eq. (15.18) with ​i = 1,2​. Because ​x​2​= 1 − ​x​1​and ​z​2​= 1 − ​z​1​​,
Eq. (15.19) can be solved to give x1 and z1 as explicit functions of the ψi’s and thus of T:

Inspection of these results verifies that ​x​i​= ​z​i​, = 1​for T
​ = ​T​m
​ ​i​​​​. Moreover, analysis shows
that both xi and zi vary monotonically with T. Hence, systems described by Eq. (15.19) exhibit
lens-shaped SLE diagrams, as shown in Fig. 15.5(a), where the upper line is the freezing curve
and the lower line is the melting curve. The liquid-solution region lies above the freezing
curve, and the solid-solution region lies below the melting curve. Examples of systems exhibiting diagrams of this type range from nitrogen/carbon monoxide at cryogenic temperatures
to copper/nickel at high temperature. Comparison of this figure with Fig. (12.12) suggests
that Case I-SLE behavior is analogous to Raoult’s-law behavior for VLE. Comparison of the
assumptions leading to Eqs. (15.19) and (13.16) confirms the analogy. As with Raoult’s law,
Eq. (15.19) rarely describes the behavior of actual systems. However, it is an important limiting case, and it serves as a standard against which observed SLE can be compared.

CHAPTER 15. Topics in Phase Equilibria

where ψ1 and ψ2 are given as functions solely of temperature by Eq. (15.22). Thus x1
and x2 are also solely functions of temperature, and Eqs. (15.23) and (15.24) can apply
simultaneously only for the particular temperature where ​ψ​1​+ ​ψ​2​= 1​and hence ​x​1​+ ​x​2​= 1​.
This is the eutectic temperature Te. Thus, three distinct equilibrium situations exist: one where
Eq. (15.23) alone applies, one where Eq. (15.24) alone applies, and the special case where
they apply together at Te.

equilibrium with pure species 1 as a solid phase. This is represented by region I on
Fig. 15.5(b), where liquid solutions with compositions x1 given by line BE are in
equilibrium with pure solid 1.
∙ Equation (15.24) alone applies. By this equation and Eq. (15.22b), with ​x​2​= 1 − ​x​1​​:

equilibrium with pure species 2 as a solid phase. This is represented by region II on
Fig. 15.5(b), where liquid solutions with compositions x1 given by line AE are in
­equilibrium with pure solid 2.
∙ Equations (15.23) and (15.24) apply simultaneously, and are set equal because they must
both give the eutectic composition x1e. The resulting expression,

		 is satisfied for the single temperature ​T = ​Te​ ​. Substitution of Te into either Eq. (15.25) or
(15.26) yields the eutectic composition. Coordinates Te and x1e define a eutectic state, a special state of three-phase equilibrium, lying along line CED on Fig. 15.5(b), for which liquid
of composition x1e coexists with pure solid 1 and pure solid 2. This is a state of solid/solid/
liquid equilibrium. At temperatures below Te the two pure immiscible solids coexist.
Figure 15.5(b), the phase diagram for Case II, is an exact analog of Fig. 12.18(a) for
immiscible liquids because the assumptions upon which its generating equations are based are
analogs of the corresponding VLLE assumptions.

15.4

SOLID/VAPOR EQUILIBRIUM (SVE)

At temperatures below its triple point, a pure solid can vaporize. Solid/vapor equilibrium for
a pure species is represented on a PT diagram by the sublimation curve (see Fig. 3.1); here,

as for VLE, the equilibrium pressure for a particular temperature is called the (solid/vapor)
saturation pressure Psat.
We consider in this section the equilibrium of a pure solid (species 1) with a binary
vapor mixture containing species 1 and a second species (species 2), assumed insoluble in
the solid phase. Because it is usually the major constituent of the vapor phase, species 2 is
conventionally called the solvent species. Hence species 1 is the solute species, and its mole
fraction y1 in the vapor phase is its solubility in the solvent. The goal is to develop a procedure
for computing y1 as a function of T and P for vapor solvents.
Only one phase-equilibrium equation can be written for this system, because species 2,
by assumption, does not distribute between the two phases. The solid is pure species 1. Thus,
	​​f​1s​  ​= ​​f ​​ˆ​​ 1v​  ​​	
Equation (10.44) for a pure liquid is, with minor change of notation, appropriate here:
​V​s​ ​(P − ​P​1sat
​  ​)
	​​f​1s​  ​= ​ϕ​1sat
​  ​​P​1sat
​  ​exp ____________
​  1
 ​
​
RT
where P
​​ ​1sat
​  ​​is the solid/vapor saturation pressure at temperature T, and V​
​​ 1s​ ​​is the molar volume
of the solid. For the vapor phase, by Eq. (10.52),
	​​​f​​  ​​ˆ1v​  ​= ​y​1​​​ϕˆ​​  1​​ P​	
Combining the three preceding equations and solving for y1 gives:
​P​sat

(15.29)

Function F1 reflects vapor-phase nonidealities through ϕ​
​​ 1sat
​  ​​ and ​​​ϕˆ​​  1​​​and the effect of
pressure on the fugacity of the solid through the exponential Poynting factor. For sufficiently
low pressures, both effects are negligible, in which case ​F​1​≈ 1​and ​y​1​≈ ​P1​sat
​  ​∕ P​. At moderate
and high pressures, vapor-phase nonidealities become important, and for very high pressures
even the Poynting factor cannot be ignored. Because F1 is generally observed to be greater
than unity, it is sometimes called an “enhancement factor” because according to Eq. (15.28)
it leads to a solid solubility greater than that which would be observed in the absence of these
pressure-induced effects.

Estimation of Solid Solubility at High Pressure
Solubilities at temperatures and pressures above the critical values of the solvent have important applications for supercritical separation processes. Examples are extraction of caffeine
from coffee beans and separation of asphaltenes from heavy petroleum fractions. For a typical
solid/vapor equilibrium (SVE) problem, the solid/vapor saturation pressure ​​P​1sat
​  ​​is very small,
and the saturated vapor is for practical purposes an ideal gas. Hence ϕ​
​​ 1sat
​  ​​for pure solute vapor
at this pressure is close to unity. Moreover, except for very low values of the system pressure
P, the solid solubility y1 is small, and ϕ
​​​ˆ​​  1​​​ can be approximated by ϕ

coefficient of the solute at infinite dilution. Finally, because P​

is important. With these usually reasonable approximations, Eq. (15.29) reduces to:

pure-species properties, found in a handbook or estimated from a suitable correlation. Quantity ϕ
​​​ ˆ​​1∞​  ​​, on the other hand, must be computed from a PVT equation of state—one suitable for
vapor mixtures at high pressures.
Cubic equations of state, such as the Soave/Redlich/Kwong (SRK) and Peng/Robinson
(PR) equations, are usually satisfactory for this kind of calculation. Equation (13.99) for ϕ
​​​ˆ​​  i​​​,
developed in Sec. 13.7, is applicable here, but with a slightly modified combining rule for
interaction parameter aij used in the calculation of q​​​¯​​  i​​​. Thus, Eq. (13.93) is replaced by:
	​
​a​ij​= (1 − ​lij​ ​) ​(​a​i​​a​j​)​​1∕2​

(15.31)

The additional binary interaction parameter lij must be found for each ij pair (​i ≠ j )​ from
experimental data. By convention, ​lij​ ​= ​lji​ ​and ​lii​ ​= ​ljj​ ​= 0​.
Partial parameter a
​​​ ¯​​  i​​​is found by application of Eq. (13.94) with a from Eq. (13.92):

Equation (15.33) is used in conjunction with Eqs. (13.81) and (13.83), which provide

As an example, consider the calculation of the solubility of naphthalene(1) in carbon
dioxide(2) at 35°C (308.15 K) and pressures up to 300 bar. Strictly speaking, this is not
solid/vapor equilibrium because the critical temperature of CO2 is 31.1°C. However, the
development of this section remains valid.
The basis is Eq. (15.30), with ϕ

Equations (15.33) and (13.83) become the SRK expressions on assignment of the values σ​ = 1​
and ε​ = 0​. Evaluation of parameters a1, a2, b1, and b2 requires values for Tc, Pc, and ω, which

Tsekhanskaya et al.4 report solubility data for naphthalene in carbon dioxide at 35°C and
high pressures, given as circles on Fig. 15.6. The sharp increase in solubility as the pressure
approaches the critical value (73.83 bar for CO2) is typical of supercritical systems. Shown for
comparison are the results of calculations based on Eqs. (15.28) and (15.30), under various
assumptions. The lowest curve shows the “ideal solubility” ​​P​1sat

factor F1 is unity. The dashed curve incorporates the Poynting effect, which is significant at the
higher pressures. The topmost curve includes the Poynting effect as well as ​​​ϕˆ1​​∞​  ​​, estimated from
Eq. (15.33) with SRK constants and with ​l12

the data requires a nonzero value for the interaction parameter; the value ​l12

the semi-quantitative representation shown on Fig. 15.6 as the second curve from the top.

EQUILIBRIUM ADSORPTION OF GASES ON SOLIDS

The process by which certain porous solids bind large numbers of molecules to their surfaces
is known as adsorption. Not only does it serve as a separation process, but it is also a vital
part of catalytic-reaction processes. As a separation process, adsorption is used most often
for removal of low-concentration impurities and pollutants from fluid streams. It is also the
basis for chromatography. In surface-catalyzed reactions, the initial step is usually adsorption
of reactant species; the final step is usually the reverse process, desorption of product species.

Because most industrially important reactions are catalytic, adsorption plays a fundamental
role in reaction engineering.
The nature of the adsorbing surface is the determining factor in adsorption. To be useful as an adsorbent, a solid must present a large surface area per unit mass (specific surface
areas up to 1500 m2 per gram are not uncommon). This can be achieved with porous solids such as activated carbon, silica gels, aluminas, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs), all of which contain many cavities or pores with diameters as small as a fraction
of a nanometer. Surfaces of such solids are necessarily irregular at the length scale of atoms
and molecules, and they present sites of particular attraction for adsorbing molecules. If the
sites are close together, the adsorbed molecules may interact with one another; if they are
sufficiently dispersed, the adsorbed molecules may interact only with the sites. Depending
upon the strength of the forces binding them to the sites, these adsorbate molecules may
be mobile or fixed in position. Relatively weak electrostatic and van der Waals interactions
favor mobility of adsorbate molecules and result in physical adsorption. On the other hand,
much stronger quasichemical forces can act to fix molecules to the surface, by chemisorption.

611

15.5. Equilibrium Adsorption of Gases on Solids

Although adsorption may be classified in several ways, the usual distinction is between physical adsorption and chemisorption. Based on the strength of the binding forces, this division is
observed experimentally in the magnitudes of the heat of adsorption.
In the adsorption of gases, the number of molecules adsorbed upon a solid surface
depends on conditions in the gas phase. For very low pressures, relatively few molecules are
adsorbed, and only a fraction of the solid surface is covered. As the gas pressure increases at a
given temperature, surface coverage increases. When all sites become occupied, the adsorbed
molecules are said to form a monolayer. Further increase in pressure promotes multilayer
adsorption. In some cases, multilayer adsorption may occur on one part of a porous solid when
vacant sites remain on another part.
The complexities of solid surfaces, particularly those of high-surface-area porous materials of greatest practical interest, limit molecular-level understanding of the adsorption process. They do not, however, prevent development of an exact thermodynamic description of
adsorption equilibrium, applicable to both physical adsorption and chemisorption and equally
to monolayer and multilayer adsorption. The thermodynamic framework is independent of any
particular theoretical or empirical description of material behavior. However, in application
such a description is essential, and meaningful results require appropriate models of behavior.
The thermodynamic treatment of gas/adsorbate equilibrium is in many respects analogous to that of vapor/liquid equilibrium. However, the definition of a system to which the
equations of thermodynamics apply presents a problem. The force field of the solid adsorbent
influences properties in the adjacent gas phase, but its effect decreases rapidly with distance.
Thus the properties of the gas change sharply in the immediate neighborhood of the solid
surface, but they do not change discontinuously. A region of change exists which contains
gradients in the properties of the gas, but the distance into the gas phase over which the solid
exerts influence cannot be precisely established.
This problem is circumvented by a construct first devised by J. W. Gibbs. Imagine that
the gas-phase properties extend unchanged up to the solid surface. Differences between the
actual and the unchanged properties can then be attributed to a mathematical surface, treated
as a two-dimensional phase with its own thermodynamic properties. This provides not only a
precisely defined surface phase to account for the singularities of the interfacial region, but it
also extracts them from the three-dimensional gas phase so that it too may be treated precisely.
The solid, despite the influence of its force field, is presumed to be inert and not otherwise to
participate in the gas/adsorbate equilibrium. Thus for purposes of thermodynamic analysis,
the adsorbate is treated as a two-dimensional phase, inherently an open system because it is in
equilibrium with the gas phase.
The fundamental property relation for an open PVT system is given by Eq. (10.2):
	​
d​(nG​)​= ​(nV ​)​dP − ​(nS​)​dT + ​∑​ ​​​μ​i​d​n​i​​	
i

An analogous equation may be written for a two-dimensional phase. The key difference
is that pressure and molar volume are not appropriate variables for a two-dimensional
phase. Pressure is replaced by the spreading pressure Π, and the molar volume by the molar
area a:
	​
d​(nG​)​= ​(na​)​dΠ − ​(nS​)​dT + ​∑​ ​​ ​μ​i​d ​n​i​
i

(15.34)

612

CHAPTER 15. Topics in Phase Equilibria

This equation is written on the basis of a unit mass, usually a gram or a kilogram, of solid
adsorbent. Thus n is the specific amount adsorbed, that is, the number of moles of adsorbate
per unit mass of adsorbent. Moreover, area A is defined as the specific surface area, that is, the
area per unit mass of adsorbent, a quantity characteristic of a particular adsorbent. The molar
area, a
​ ≡ A ∕ n​, is the surface area per mole of adsorbate.
The spreading pressure is the two-dimensional analog of pressure, having units of force
per unit length, akin to surface tension. It can be pictured as the force in the plane of the surface that must be exerted perpendicular to each unit length of edge to keep the surface from
spreading, that is, to keep it in mechanical equilibrium. It is not subject to direct experimental
measurement, and it must be calculated, significantly complicating the treatment of adsorbedphase equilibrium.
Because the spreading pressure adds an extra variable, the number of degrees of freedom for gas/adsorbate equilibrium is given by an altered version of the phase rule. For gas/
adsorbate equilibrium, ​π = 2​; therefore,
	​
F = N − π + 3 = N − 2 + 3 = N + 1​	
Thus for adsorption of a pure species,
	​
F = 1 + 1 = 2​	
and two phase-rule variables, e.g., T and P or T and n, must be fixed independently to establish an equilibrium state. Note that the inert solid phase is counted neither as a phase nor as a
species.
Recall the summability relation for the Gibbs energy, which follows from Eqs. (10.8)
and (10.12):
	​
nG = ​∑​ ​​ ​n​i​​μ​i​​	
i

Differentiation gives:	​
d​(nG​)​= ​∑​ ​​ ​μ​i​d ​n​i​+ ​∑​ ​​ ​n​i​d ​μ​i​​

Comparison with Eq. (15.34) shows:

i

or	​
SdT − adΠ + ​∑​ ​​ ​x​i​d​μ​i​ = 0​

This is the Gibbs/Duhem equation for the adsorbate. Restricting it to constant temperature
produces the Gibbs adsorption isotherm:

Pure-Gas Adsorption
Basic to the experimental study of pure-gas adsorption are measurements at constant temperature of n, the moles of gas adsorbed, as a function of P, the pressure in the gas phase. Each set
of data represents an adsorption isotherm for the pure gas on a particular solid adsorbent.
Available data are summarized by Valenzuela and Myers.5 The correlation of such data
requires an analytical relation between n and P, and such a relation should be consistent with
Eq. (15.36).

This general relation between n, the moles adsorbed, and P, the gas-phase pressure,
includes z, the adsorbate compressibility factor, which may be represented by an equation of
state for the adsorbate. The simplest such equation is the ideal-gas analog, z​ = 1​, and in this
case Eq. (15.39) yields n​ = kP, ​which is Henry’s law for adsorption.
An equation of state known as the ideal-lattice-gas equation6 has been developed specifically for an adsorbate:

bind an adsorbate molecule, and that the bound molecules do not interact with each other. The
validity of this model is therefore limited to no more than monolayer coverage. Substitution of
this equation into Eq. (15.39) and integration leads to the Langmuir isotherm:7

At the other extreme, where P → ∞, n approaches m, the saturation value of the specific
amount absorbed, representing full monolayer coverage.
Based on the same assumptions as for the ideal-lattice-gas equation, Langmuir in 1918
derived Eq. (15.40) by noting that at equilibrium the rate of adsorption and the rate of desorption of gas molecules must be the same.8 For monolayer adsorption, the number of sites may
be divided into the fraction occupied θ and the fraction vacant 1− θ. By definition,

where m is the value of n for full monolayer coverage. For the assumed conditions, the rate of
adsorption is proportional to the rate at which molecules strike unoccupied sites on the surface, which in turn is proportional to both the pressure and the fraction 1 − θ of unoccupied
surface sites. The rate of desorption is proportional to the occupied fraction θ of sites. Equating the two rates gives:

Eq. (15.40), and it indicates that the adsorption equilibrium constant is equal to Henry’s constant divided by m, i.e., K
​ = k ∕ m.​
Because the assumptions upon which it is based are fulfilled at low surface coverage,
the Langmuir isotherm is always valid as θ → 0 and as n → 0. Even though these assumptions
become unrealistic at higher surface coverage, the Langmuir isotherm may provide an approximate overall fit to n vs. P data; however, it does not lead to reasonable values for m.

No equation of state is known that leads to an adsorption isotherm which in general fits
experimental data over the entire range of n from zero to full monolayer coverage. Isotherms
that find practical use are often three-parameter empirical extensions of the Langmuir isotherm. An example is the Toth equation:9
mP
	​
n = ________
​
​
​(b + ​P​t​)​​1∕t​

(15.44)

which adds an exponent (t) as the third parameter and reduces to the Langmuir equation
for t​ = 1​. When the integrand of Eq. (15.42) is expressed by the Toth equation and most
other three-parameter equations, its integration requires numerical methods. Moreover, the
empirical element of such equations often introduces a singularity that makes them behave
improperly in the limit as P → 0. Thus for the Toth equation (t < 1) the second derivative
d 2n∕dP2 approaches −∞ in this limit, making values of Henry’s constant as calculated by
this equation too large. Nevertheless, the Toth equation finds frequent practical use as an
adsorption isotherm. However, it is not always suitable, and a number of other adsorption
isotherms are in use, as discussed by Suzuki.10 Among them, the Freundlich equation,

is a two-parameter (α and β) isotherm that often successfully correlates experimental data for
low and intermediate values of θ.

pairs of values (P, n), where P is the equilibrium gas pressure in kPa and n is moles
of adsorbate per kg of adsorbent. Trends shown by the data are typical for physical
adsorption on a heterogeneous adsorbent at low-to-moderate surface coverage. Use
these data to illustrate numerically the concepts developed for pure-gas adsorption.

The solid line in Fig. 15.7 represents a curve-fit to the data by Eq. (15.44), the Toth
equation, with parameter values as reported by Valenzuela and Myers (loc. cit.):
	​
​m = 4.7087​

Although the overall quality of the fit is excellent, the value of Henry’s constant is
too large, as we will show.
Extraction of Henry’s constant from an adsorption isotherm is facilitated when
n∕P (rather than n) is considered the dependent variable and n (rather than P) the
independent variable. The data plotted in this form are shown by Fig. 15.8. On this

where the second equality follows from the first because n → 0 as P → 0. Evaluation of the intercept (and hence of k) was done in this case by fitting all of the n∕P
data by a cubic polynomial in n:

Whence,	​
k = ​C​0​= 0.4016 ​mol·kg​​−1​​· kPa​​−1​​
Representation of n∕P by the cubic polynomial appears as the solid curve in
Fig. 15.8, and the extrapolated intercept (​​C​0​= k = 0.4016​) is indicated by an open
circle. For comparison, the dotted line is the low-n portion of the n∕P curve given
by the Toth equation. Here it is apparent that the extrapolated intercept k(Toth),
off-scale on this figure, is too high. The Toth equation cannot provide an accurate
representation of adsorption behavior at very low values of n or P.
The Langmuir equation, on the other hand, is always suitable for sufficiently
small n or P. Rearrangement of Eq. (15.41) gives:

which shows that the Langmuir equation implies a linear variation of n∕P with n.
Hence, the limiting tangent to the “true” isotherm on a plot of n∕P vs. n represents
the Langmuir approximation to the isotherm for small n, as shown by the dashed

Figures 15.7 and 15.8 show that Henry’s law (represented by the dot-dash lines)
and the limiting form of the Langmuir equation provide, respectively, in this
example upper and lower bounds for the actual isotherm. The Langmuir
isotherm when fit to all the experimental data yields a curve (not shown) in
Fig. 15.7 that fits the data reasonably well, but not as well as the three-parameter
Toth expression.
Neither the spreading pressure nor the adsorbate equation of state is required for
an empirical correlation of single-species adsorption data. However, a set of (n, P)
data implies an equation of state for the adsorbed phase, and hence a relationship
between the spreading pressure Π and the moles adsorbed. By Eq. (15.42),

The adsorptive capacity of an adsorbent depends directly on its specific surface area A,
but determination of these large values is not a trivial matter. The means is provided by the
adsorption process itself. The basic idea is to measure the quantity of a gas adsorbed at full
monolayer coverage and to multiply the number of molecules adsorbed by the area occupied by
a single molecule. Two difficulties attend this procedure. First is the problem of detecting the
point of full monolayer coverage. Second, one finds measured areas are different with different
gases as adsorbates. The latter problem is generally circumvented by the adoption of nitrogen
as a standard adsorbate. The procedure is to make measurements of the (physical) adsorption
of N2 at its normal boiling point (−195.8°C) for pressures up to its vapor pressure of l(atm).
The result is a curve that initially, at low P, looks like that in Fig. 15.7. When ­monolayer coverage is nearly complete, multilayer adsorption begins, and the curve changes direction, with
n increasing ever more rapidly with pressure. Finally, as the pressure approaches l(atm), the
vapor pressure of the N2 adsorbate, the curve becomes nearly vertical because of condensation
in the pores of the adsorbent. The problem is to identify the point on the curve that represents
full monolayer coverage. The usual procedure is to fit the Brunauer/Emmett/Teller (BET)
equation, a two-parameter extension of the Langmuir isotherm to multilayer adsorption, to the
n vs. P data. From this, one can determine a value for m.12 Once m is known, multiplication by
Avogadro’s number and by the area occupied by one adsorbed N2 molecule (16.2 Å2) yields
the surface area. The method has its uncertainties, particularly for molecular sieves where the
pores may contain unadsorbed molecules. Nevertheless, it is a useful and widely used tool for
characterizing and comparing adsorption capacities.

Heat of Adsorption
The Clapeyron equation, derived in Sec. 6.5 for the latent heat of phase transition of pure
chemical species, is also applicable to pure-gas adsorption equilibrium. Here, however, the
two-phase equilibrium pressure depends not only on temperature but also on surface coverage
or the amount adsorbed. Thus the analogous equation for adsorption is written

where subscript n signifies that the derivative is taken at constant amount adsorbed. Superscript av denotes a property change of desorption, i.e., the difference between the vapor-phase

621

15.5. Equilibrium Adsorption of Gases on Solids

and the adsorbed-phase property. The quantity Δ
​ ​H​aν​ ≡ ​H​ν​ − ​H​a​ is defined as the isosteric
heat of adsorption and is usually a positive quantity.13 The heat of adsorption is a useful indication of the strength of the forces binding adsorbed molecules to the surface of the adsorbent,
and its magnitude can therefore often be used to distinguish between physical adsorption and
chemisorption.
The dependence of heats of adsorption on surface coverage has its basis in the energetic
heterogeneity of most solid surfaces. The first sites on a surface to be occupied are those
which attract adsorbate molecules most strongly and with the greatest release of energy. Thus
the heat of adsorption usually decreases with surface coverage. Once all sites are occupied
and multilayer adsorption begins, the dominant forces become those between adsorbate molecules, and for subcritical species the decreasing heat of adsorption approaches the heat of
vaporization.
Assumed in the derivation of the Langmuir isotherm is the energetic equivalence of all
adsorption sites, implying that the heat of adsorption is independent of surface coverage. This
explains in part the inability of the Langmuir isotherm to provide a close fit to most experimental data over a wide range of surface coverage. The Freundlich isotherm, Eq. (15.45),
implies a logarithmic decrease in the heat of adsorption with surface coverage.
As in the development of the Clausius/Clapeyron equation (Example 6.6), if for low
pressures one assumes that the gas phase is ideal and that the adsorbate is of negligible volume
compared with the gas-phase volume, Eq. (15.46) becomes:

∂ ln P
	​​ ​ _____
​ 2​
​ 
 ​ ​​  ​​ = _____
( ∂T )
R​T​ ​

n

Application of this equation requires the measurement of isotherms, such as the one at 50°C in
Fig. 15.7, at several temperatures. Cross plotting yields sets of P vs. T relations at constant n,
from which values for the partial derivative of Eq. (15.47) can be obtained. For chemisorption,
ΔHav values usually range from 60 to 170 kJ·mol−1. For physical adsorption, they are smaller.
For example, measured values at very low coverage for the physical adsorption of nitrogen and
n-butane on 5A zeolite are 18.0 and 43.1 kJ·mol−1, respectively.14

Mixed-Gas Adsorption
Mixed-gas adsorption is treated similarly to the gamma/phi formulation of VLE (Sec. 13.2).

fugacity, are rewritten:

These equations show that equality of fugacities is not a proper criterion for gas/adsorbate equilibrium. This is also evident from the fact that the units of gas-phase fugacities are
those of pressure, while the units of adsorbate fugacities are those of spreading pressure. In
most applications the fugacities appear as ratios, and the factor ki RT/A cancels. Nevertheless
it is instructive to note that equality of chemical potentials, not fugacities, is the fundamental
criterion of phase equilibrium.

15.5. Equilibrium Adsorption of Gases on Solids

An activity coefficient for the constituent species of a mixed-gas adsorbate is defined
by the equation:
​​fˆ​​  ​​ i​​
	​
​γ​i​≡ ​ ____° ​​	
​x​i​​f​ i​  ​
where f​​​ ˆ​​  ​​ i​​​ and f​​ ​  i°​  ​​are evaluated at the same T and spreading pressure Π. The degree sign (°)
denotes values for the equilibrium adsorption of pure i at the spreading pressure of the mixture. Substitution for the fugacities by Eqs. (15.54) and (15.55) gives:
g
​​f ​​ˆi​​  ​  ​(P)
_______
	​
​γ​i​= ​  g
 ​​	
​x​  i​​ ​fi​​  ​(​P​ i°​  ​)
The fugacities are evaluated at the pressures indicated in parentheses, where P is the equilibrium mixed-gas pressure and P​ 
​​ i°​  ​​is the equilibrium pure-gas pressure that produces the same
spreading pressure. If the gas-phase fugacities are eliminated in favor of fugacity coefficients
[Eqs. (10.34) and (10.52)], then:
​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​ P
	​
​γ​i​= ______
​ 
 ​​	
​x​i​​ϕi​​​P​ i°​  ​
or	​
​y​i​​​ϕˆ​​  i​​ P = ​x​i​​ϕi​​​P​  °​  ​​γ​i​
(15.56)
i

The usual assumption is that the gas phase is ideal; the fugacity coefficients are then unity:
	​
​y​i​P = ​x​i​​P​ i°​  ​​γ​i​

(15.57)

These equations provide the means for calculation of activity coefficients from mixedgas adsorption data. Alternatively, if γi values can be predicted, they allow calculation of
adsorbate composition. In particular, if the mixed-gas adsorbate forms an ideal solution, then
γ = 1, and the resulting equation is the adsorption analog of Raoult’s law:
	​
​y​i​P = ​x​i​​P​ i°​  ​​

(15.58)

This equation is always valid as P → 0 and within the pressure range for which Henry’s law is
a suitable approximation.
Equation (15.42) is applicable not only for pure-gas adsorption but also for adsorption of
a constant-composition gas mixture. Applied where Henry’s law is valid, it yields:
ΠA
____
	​
​ ​= kP​

where k is the mixed-gas Henry’s constant. For adsorption of pure species i at the same spreading pressure, this becomes:
ΠA
____
	​
​ ​= ​ki​​​P​ i°​  ​​

Combining these two equations with Eq. (15.58) gives:

k = ​∑​ ​​y​i​​ki​​​

This simple equation, requiring only data for pure-gas adsorption, provides adsorbate compositions in the limit as P → 0.
For an ideal adsorbed solution, in analogy with Eq. (10.81) for volumes,
	​
a = ​∑​ ​​x​i​​a​  i°​  ​​	
i

where a is the molar area for the mixed-gas adsorbate and a​ ​​ i°​  ​​is the molar area of the pure-gas

this equation may be written:

where n is the specific amount of mixed-gas adsorbate and ​​n​  i°​  ​​is the specific amount of pure-i
adsorbate at the same spreading pressure. The amount of species i in the mixed-gas adsorbate
is of course ​n​i​= ​x​i​n​.
The prediction of mixed-gas adsorption equilibria by ideal-adsorbed-solution theory15
is based on Eqs. (15.58) and (15.62). The following is a brief outline of the procedure. Because
there are N + 1 degrees of freedom, both T and P, as well as the gas-phase composition, must
be specified. Solution is for the adsorbate composition and the specific amount adsorbed.
Adsorption isotherms for each pure species must be known over the pressure range from zero
to the value that produces the spreading pressure of the mixed-gas adsorbate. For purposes
of illustration we assume Eq. (15.41), the Langmuir isotherm, to apply for each pure species,
writing it:

The following steps then constitute a solution procedure:
∙ An initial estimate of ψ is found from the Henry’s-law equations. Combining the definition of ψ with Eqs. (15.59) and (15.60) yields:
	​
ψ = P​∑​ ​​ ​y​i​​ki​​​	
i

∙ With this estimate of ψ, calculate ​​P​ i°​  ​​for each species i by Eq. (B) and ​​n​  i°​  ​​ for each ­species
i by Eq. (A).
∙ One can show that the error in ψ is approximated by:

		 Moreover, the approximation becomes increasingly exact as δψ decreases. If δψ is
smaller than some preset tolerance (say δψ < ψ × 10−7), the calculation goes to the final
step; if not, a new value, ψ = ψ + δψ, is determined, and the calculation returns to the
preceding step.
∙ Calculate xi for each species i by Eq. (15.58):
​y​i​P
	​
​x​i​= ____
​  ° ​​	
​P​ i​  ​
		 Calculate the specific amount absorbed by Eq. (15.62).
Use of the Langmuir isotherm has made this computational scheme appear quite simple,
because direct solution for P​ 
​​ i°​  ​​(step 2) is possible. However, most equations for the adsorption
isotherm are less tractable, and this calculation must be done numerically. This significantly
increases the computational task, but it does not alter the general procedure.
Predictions of adsorption equilibria by ideal-adsorbed-solution theory are usually
satisfactory when the specific amount adsorbed is less than a third of the saturation value for
monolayer coverage. At higher adsorbed amounts, appreciable negative deviations from ideality
are promoted by differences in size of the adsorbate molecules and by adsorbent heterogeneity.
One must then have recourse to Eq. (15.57). The difficulty is in obtaining values of the activity
coefficients, which are strong functions of both spreading pressure and temperature. This
contrasts with activity coefficients for liquid phases, which for most applications are insensitive
to pressure. This topic is treated by Talu et al.16

water requires the separation of more-or-less pure water from an aqueous solution containing
dissolved solute species. Historically, this has been achieved by distillation. However, in recent
years reverse osmosis has outpaced distillation, and the majority of worldwide desalination
capacity consists of reverse osmosis facilities. Central to an understanding of osmotic separations are the concepts of osmotic equilibrium and osmotic pressure, the topics of this section.
Consider the idealized physical situation represented by Fig. 15.9. A chamber is divided
into two compartments by a rigid semipermeable partition (membrane). The left compartment contains a binary solute(l)/solvent(2) liquid mixture, and the right contains pure solvent; the partition is permeable to solvent species 2 only. Temperature is uniform and constant
throughout, but movable pistons permit independent adjustment of the pressures in the two
compartments.

Suppose that pressure is the same in the two compartments: P
​ ′= P​. This implies inequality of the fugacity f​​ ​​​ˆ ​​ 2​​​of the only distributed species (the solvent), for by Eq. (15.2),

Thus, if P
​ ′= P​, the solvent fugacity is smaller in the left compartment than in the right. The
difference in solvent fugacities represents a driving force for mass transfer, and solvent diffuses through the partition, from right to left.
Equilibrium is established when pressure P′ is increased to an appropriate value P*,
such that
	​​f​​ ˆ ​​ 2​​(T, P′ = ​P​*​, ​x​2​< 1 ) = ​f​2​(T, P)
The pressure difference, ​Π ≡ ​P​*​− P​, is the osmotic pressure of the solution, defined implicitly
through the equilibrium equation for species 2, which in abbreviated form is:

15.6. Osmotic Equilibrium and Osmotic Pressure

Equation (15.63) is a basis for developing explicit expressions for osmotic pressure Π.
Development is facilitated by the identity:
​​  f​​ ˆ ​​ 2​​(P, ​x​2​) ___________
 ​​fˆ​​  ​​ 2​​(P + Π, ​x​2​)
	​​​f​​ ˆ ​​ 2​​(P + Π, ​x​2​) ≡ ​f​2​(P ) ⋅ ________
​ 
 ​ ⋅   
​ 
 ​​
​f​2​(P)
​​fˆ​​  ​​ 2​​(P, ​x​2​)

(15.64)

The first ratio on the right is, by Eq. (13.2),
​​fˆ​​  ​​ 2​​(P, ​x​2​)
	​​ ________
 ​ = ​x​2​​γ​2​​	
​f​2​(P )
where γ2 is the activity coefficient of solvent in the mixture at pressure P. The second ratio is
a Poynting factor, representing here a pressure effect on the fugacity of a species in solution.
An expression for this factor is readily found from Eq. (10.46):
∂ ln ​​fˆ​​  ​​ i​​

Thus, for solvent species 2,	​​​ ​_____

 ​ = exp ​ ​  ​___
​   ​ dP ​​

​​fˆ​​  ​​ 2​​​(P, ​x​2​)​

Equation (15.64) therefore becomes:

Combination with Eq. (15.63) yields:

or	​​​ ​

​​   ​ dP ​ = − ln (​x​2​​γ​2​)​​

(15.65)

Equation (15.65) is exact; working expressions for Π follow by rational approximation.
If we ignore the effect of pressure on ​​​V¯ ​​  2​​​, the integral becomes ​Π ​​V¯​​  2​​ ∕ RT​. Solution for Π
then yields:

If in addition the solution is sufficiently dilute in solute 1,
	​​​V¯​​  2​​ ≈ ​V​2​   ​γ​2​≈ 1   and   ln (​x​2​​γ​2​) ≈ ln (1 − ​x​1​) ≈ − ​x​1​​

With these approximations, Eq. (15.66) becomes:
​x​1​RT
	​
Π = _____
​
​
​V​2​

(15.67)

Equation (15.67) is known as the van’t Hoff equation.17
Equation (15.65) is valid when species 1 is a nonelectrolyte. If the solute is a strong
(completely dissociated) electrolyte containing m ions, then the right side is:
	​​− ln​(​​x​2m​  ​​γ​2​)​​​	
and the van’t Hoff equation becomes:
m​x​1​RT
	​
Π = _______
​
​​	
​V​2​
Osmotic pressure can be quite large, even for very dilute solutions. Consider an aqueous
solution containing mole fraction ​x​1​= 0.001​of a nonelectrolyte solute species at 25°C. Then

​
​× 298.15 K = 1.38 bar​	
18.02 ​cm​​ ​
mol·K
With reference to Fig. 15.9, this means that for a pure solvent pressure P = 1 bar, the pressure
P′ on the solution must be 2.38 bar to prevent diffusion of solvent from right to left, i.e., to
establish osmotic equilibrium.18 Pressures P′ greater than this value make:
	​​f​​ ˆ ​​ 2​​(P′, ​x​2​) > ​f​2​(P)
and a driving force exists for transfer of water (solvent) from left to right. This observation
serves as motivation for the process of reverse osmosis, wherein a solvent (commonly water) is
separated from a solution by the application of sufficient pressure to provide the driving force
needed for solvent transfer through a membrane that, for practical purposes, is permeable only
to the solvent. The minimum pressure difference (solution pressure vs. pure-solvent pressure)
is the osmotic pressure Π.
In practice, pressure differences significantly greater than Π are used to drive reverse
osmosis. For example, seawater has an osmotic pressure of about 25 bar, but working pressures of 50 to 80 bar are employed to enhance the rate of recovery of fresh water. A feature
of such separations is that they require mechanical power only for pumping the solution to an
appropriate pressure level. This contrasts with distillation schemes, where steam is the usual
source of energy. A brief overview of reverse osmosis is given by Perry and Green.19

18Note that, unlike conventional phase equilibrium, pressures are unequal for osmotic equilibrium, owing to the
special constraints imposed by the rigid semipermeable partition.

15.9. Vapor sulfur hexafluoride SF6 at pressures of about 1600 kPa is used as a dielectric in
large primary circuit breakers for electric transmission systems. As liquids, SF6 and
H2O are essentially immiscible, and one must therefore specify a low enough moisture
content in the vapor SF6 so that if condensation occurs in cold weather, a liquid water
phase will not form first in the system. For a preliminary determination, assume the vapor
phase can be treated as an ideal gas and prepare the phase diagram [like Fig. 12.18(a)]

Chapter 16
Thermodynamic Analysis of
Processes

The purpose of this chapter is to present a procedure for the analysis of practical processes
from a thermodynamic perspective. It is an extension of the ideal work and lost work concepts
presented in Secs. 5.7 and 5.8.
Real irreversible processes are amenable to thermodynamic analysis. The goal of such
an analysis is to determine how efficiently energy is used or produced and to show quantitatively the effect of inefficiencies in each step of a process. The cost of energy is of concern in
any manufacturing operation, and the first step in any attempt to reduce energy requirements
is to determine where and to what extent energy is wasted through process irreversibilities.
The treatment here is limited to steady-state flow processes, because of their predominance in
industrial practice.

16.1 THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF STEADY-STATE
FLOW PROCESSES
Most industrial processes involving fluids consist of multiple steps, and lost-work calculations
are then made for each step separately. By Eq. (5.29),
	​​​W˙ ​​lost​​ = ​Tσ​ ​​​S˙​​G​​​	
For a single surroundings temperature Tσ, summing over the steps of a process gives:
	​
Σ​​W˙ ​​lost​​ = ​Tσ​ ​Σ​​S˙​​G​​​	
Dividing the former equation by the latter yields:
​W˙ ​lost​ ____
​S˙​G​
______
	​
​
​= ​
​​	
˙
Σ​​Wl​ost​ Σ​​S˙G
​​
Thus an analysis of the lost work, made by calculation of the fraction that each individual lostwork term represents of the total, is the same as an analysis of the rate of entropy generation,
636

637

16.1. Thermodynamic Analysis of Steady-State Flow Processes

made by expressing each individual entropy-generation term as a fraction of the sum of all
entropy-generation terms. Recall that all terms in these equations are positive.
An alternative to the lost-work or entropy-generation analysis is a work analysis. For
this, Eq. (5.26) becomes:
	​
Σ​W˙ ​lost​= ​W˙ ​s​− ​W˙ ​ideal​

(16.1)

For a work-requiring process, all of these work quantities are positive and W
​​ ˙ ​s​ > ​​W˙ ​​ideal. The
preceding equation is then written:
	​
​W˙ ​s​= ​W˙ ​ideal​+ Σ​​W˙ ​lost​

(16.2)

A work analysis expresses each individual work term on the right as a fraction of W
​​ ˙ ​​s.
For a work-producing process, W
​​ ˙ ​​s and W
​​ ˙ ​​ideal are negative, and |​​​W˙ ​ideal|​​ > ​​|​W˙ ​s|​​. Equation
(16.1) is therefore best written:

|

| | |

	​
​​W˙ ​ideal​​= ​​W˙ ​s​​+ Σ​​W˙ ​lost​

(16.3)

A work analysis expresses each individual work term on the right as a fraction of |​​​W˙ ​ideal|​​. Such
an analysis cannot be carried out if a process is so inefficient that ​​W˙ ​​ideal is negative, indicating
that the process should produce work, but W
​​˙ s​​ is positive, indicating that the process in fact
requires work. A lost-work or entropy-generation analysis is always possible.

Example 16.1
The operating conditions of a practical steam power plant are described in Ex. 8.1,
parts (b) and (c). In addition, steam is generated in a furnace/boiler unit where methane
is burned completely to CO2 and H2O with 25% excess air. The flue gas leaving the furnace has a temperature of 460 K, and Tσ = 298.15 K. Make a thermodynamic analysis
of the power plant.

Because the steam undergoes a cyclic process, the only changes that must be
considered for calculation of the ideal work are those of the gases passing through
the furnace. The reaction occurring is:

atmospheric pressure and 460 K. For this change of state, ΔH and ΔS are calculated for the path shown in Fig. 16.2. The assumption of ideal gases is reasonable
here and is the basis of calculation for ΔH and ΔS for each of the four steps shown
in Fig. 16.2.

Each individual heat capacity is multiplied by the number of moles of that

gives total mean heat capacities for the 12.905 mol of mixture:

The steam rate found in Ex. 8.1 is ​​m˙ ​​= 84.75 kg·s−1. An energy balance for the

or	​

The rate of entropy generation in each of the four units of the power plant is
calculated by Eq. (5.17), and the lost work is then given by Eq. (5.29).
∙ Furnace/boiler: We have assumed no heat transfer from the furnace/boiler to the

The thermodynamic efficiency of the power plant is 27.3%, and the major source
of inefficiency is the furnace/boiler. The combustion process itself accounts for
most of the entropy generation in this unit, and the remainder is the result of heat
transfer across finite temperature differences.

Example 16.2
Methane is liquefied in a simple Linde system, as shown in Fig. 16.3. The methane
enters the compressor at 1 bar and 300 K, and after compression to 60 bar it is cooled
back to 300 K. The product is saturated liquid methane at 1 bar. The unliquefied
­methane, also at 1 bar, is returned through a heat exchanger, where it is heated to
295 K by the high-pressure methane. A heat leak into the heat exchanger of 5 kJ is
assumed for each kilogram of methane entering the compressor. Heat leaks to other
parts of the liquefier are assumed negligible. Make a thermodynamic analysis of the
process for a surroundings temperature of Tσ = 300 K.

Solution 16.2
Methane compression from 1 to 60 bar is assumed to be carried out in a threestage machine with inter- and aftercooling to 300 K and a compressor efficiency
of 75%. The actual work of this compression is estimated as 1000 kJ per kilogram
of methane. The fraction of the methane that is liquefied z is calculated by an
energy balance:
	​
​H4​ ​z + ​H6​ ​(​1 − z​)​− ​H2​ ​= Q​	
where Q
​ ​is the heat leak from the surroundings. Solution for z gives

The largest loss occurs in the throttling step. Replacing this highly irreversible process with a turbine results in a considerable increase in efficiency. Of
course, it would also result in a considerable increase in the capital cost of the
equipment.
From the standpoint of energy conservation, the thermodynamic efficiency of a process
should be as high as possible and the entropy generation or lost work as low as possible.
The final design depends largely on economic considerations, and the cost of energy is an
important factor. The thermodynamic analysis of a specific process shows the locations of the
major inefficiencies and hence the pieces of equipment or steps in the process that could be
altered or replaced to advantage. However, this sort of analysis gives no hint as to the nature
of the changes that might be made. It merely shows that the present design is wasteful of
energy and that there is room for improvement. One function of the chemical engineer is to
try to devise a better process and to use ingenuity to keep operating costs, as well as capital
expenditures, low. Each newly devised process may, of course, be analyzed to determine what
improvement has been made.

SYNOPSIS

After studying this chapter, including the end-of-chapter problems, one should be able to
∙ Carry out a step-by-step thermodynamic analysis of a steady-flow process like those
illustrated in Ex. 16.1 and Ex. 16.2
∙ Identify the contributions of each process step to the overall rate of entropy generation
of the process
∙ Assign the contributions of each process step to the overall lost work of the process, to
identify the best opportunities for improving the thermodynamic efficiency of the overall process

PROBLEMS

16.1. A plant takes in water at 21°C, cools it to 0°C, and freezes it at this temperature,
producing 0.5 kg·s−1 of ice. Heat rejection is at 21°C. The heat of fusion of water is
333.5 kJ·kg−1.
(a) What is W
​​ ˙ ​​ideal for the process?
(b) What is the power requirement of a single Carnot heat pump operating between
0 and 21°C? What is the thermodynamic efficiency of this process? What is its
irreversible feature?
(c) What is the power requirement if an ideal tetrafluoroethane vapor-compression
refrigeration cycle is used? Ideal here implies isentropic compression, infinite
cooling-water rate in the condenser, and minimum heat-transfer driving forces in

646

CHAPTER 16. Thermodynamic Analysis of Processes
evaporator and condenser of 0°C. What is the thermodynamic efficiency of this
process? What are its irreversible features?
(d ) What is the power requirement of a tetrafluoroethane vapor-compression cycle for
which the compressor efficiency is 75%, the minimum temperature differences in
evaporator and condenser are 5°C, and the temperature rise of the cooling water in
the condenser is 10°C? Make a thermodynamic analysis of this process.

16.2. Consider a steady-flow process in which the following gas-phase reaction takes place:​
CO + _​12 ​​O​2​→ ​CO​2​. The surroundings are at 300 K.
(a) What is Wideal when the reactants enter the process as pure carbon monoxide and
as air containing the stoichiometric amount of oxygen, both at 25°C and 1 bar, and
the products of complete combustion leave the process at the same conditions?
(b) The overall process is exactly the same as in (a), but the CO is here burned in an
adiabatic reactor at 1 bar. What is Wideal for the process of cooling the flue gases to
25°C? What is the irreversible feature of the overall process? What is its thermodynamic efficiency? What has increased in entropy, and by how much?
16.3. A plant has saturated steam available at 2700 kPa, but there is little use for this steam.
Rather, steam at 1000 kPa is required. Also available is saturated steam at 275 kPa.
A suggestion is that the 275 kPa steam be compressed to 1000 kPa using the work of
expanding the 2700 kPa steam to 1000 kPa. The two streams at 1000 kPa would then
be mixed. Determine the rates at which steam at each initial pressure must be supplied
to provide enough steam at 1000 kPa so that upon condensation to saturated liquid,
heat in the amount of 300 kJ·s−1 is released
(a) if the process is carried out in a completely reversible manner.
(b) if the higher-pressure steam expands in a turbine of 78% efficiency and the

16.7. A colloidal solution enters a single-effect evaporator at 100°C. Water is vaporized
from the solution, producing a more concentrated solution and 0.5 kg·s−1 of steam
at 100°C. This steam is compressed and sent to the heating coils of the evaporator to
supply the heat required for its operation. For a minimum heat-transfer driving force
across the evaporator coils of 10°C, for a compressor efficiency of 75%, and for adiabatic operation, what is the state of the steam leaving the heating coils of the evaporator? For a surroundings temperature of 300 K, make a thermodynamic analysis of the
process.
16.8. Make a thermodynamic analysis of the process described in Prob. 8.9. Tσ = 27°C.
16.9. Make a thermodynamic analysis of the process described in Ex. 9.3. Tσ = 295 K.

Appendix A
Conversion Factors and Values
of the Gas Constant

Because standard reference books contain data in diverse units, we include Tables A.1 and
A.2 to aid in the conversion of values from one set of units to another. Those units having no
­connection with the SI system are enclosed in parentheses. The following definitions are noted:
(ft)=≡ U.S. defined foot ≡ 0.3048 m
(in)=≡ U.S. defined inch ≡ 0.0254 m
(gal)=≡ U.S. liquid gallon ≡ 231 (in)3
(lbm)=≡ U.S. defined pound mass (avoirdupois)
=≡ 0.45359237 kg
(lbf)=≡ force to accelerate 1(lbm) by 32.1740 (ft)·s−2
(atm)=≡ standard atmospheric pressure ≡ 101,325 Pa
(psia)=≡ pounds force per square inch absolute pressure
(torr)=≡ pressure exerted by 1 mm mercury at 0°C and standard gravity
(cal)=≡ thermochemical calorie
(Btu)=≡ international steam table British thermal unit
(lb mole)=≡ mass in pounds mass with numerical value equal to the molar mass
(R)=≡ absolute temperature in Rankines
The conversion factors of Table A.1 are referred to a single basic or derived unit of the
SI system. Conversions between other pairs of units for a given quantity are made as in the
following example:
	​
1 bar = 0.986923 (atm) = 750.061 (torr)​	
thus
750.061
	​
1 (atm) = _________
​
​= 760.00 (torr)​

Notes
1. The standard property changes of formation ​Δ​H​  ​f°​298​​​​and ​Δ​G​  ​f°​298​​​​are the changes occurring
when 1 mol of the listed compound is formed from its elements with each substance in
its standard state at 298.15 K (25°C), except as noted in Note 2.
2. Conventions used in this table are that ​Δ​G​  ​f°​298
 ​​​ = Δ​H​  ​f°​298
 ​​​ = 0​for H+ and for oxidized
−
nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide ​​(​ ​NAD​  ox ​)​​  ​​​. For the latter, and other NAD species, no
molecular formula is provided because their properties are computed relative to this
convention rather than relative to the elements in their standard states.

Steam Tables

INTERPOLATION
When a value is required from a table at conditions which lie between listed values, interpolation is necessary. If M, the quantity sought, is a function of a single independent variable
X and if linear interpolation is appropriate, as in the tables for saturated steam, then a direct
proportionality exists between corresponding differences in M and in X. When M, the value at
X, is intermediate between two given values, M1 at X1 and M2 at X2, then:
​X​2​− X
X − ​X​1​
	​
M=​ _
​
​ ​M​ ​+ ​ _
​
​ ​M​ ​​	
( ​X​2​− ​X​1​) 1 ( ​X​2​− ​X​1​) 2

(E.1)

For example, the enthalpy of saturated vapor steam at 140.8°C is intermediate between
the following values taken from Table E.1:
t

H

t1 = 140°C
t = 140.8°C
t2 = 142°C

H1 = 2733.1 kJ·kg−1
H=?
H2 = 2735.6 kJ·kg−1

Substitution of values into Eq. (E.1) with M = H and t = X yields:
1.2
0.8
	​
H = ___
​ ​(2733.1) + ___
​ ​(2735.6) = 2734.1 kJ·​kg​​  −1​​	
2
2
When M is a function of two independent variables X and Y and linear interpolation is
appropriate, as in the tables for superheated steam, then double linear interpolation is required.
Data for quantity M at values of the independent variables X and Y adjacent to the given values
are represented as follows:
X1

Example E.1
From data in the steam tables, find:
a. The specific volume of superheated steam at 816 kPa and 512°C.
b. The temperature and specific entropy of superheated steam at P = 2950 kPa
and H = 3150.6 kJ·kg−1.

Solution E.1
(a) The following table shows specific volumes from Table E.2 for superheated
steam at conditions adjacent to those specified:
P/kPa

t = 500°C

800
816
825

APPENDIX E. Steam Tables
Here, the direct use of Eq. (E.2) is not convenient. Rather, for P = 2950 kPa, interpolate linearly at t1 = 350°C for ​H​t​​1​​ and at t2 = 375°C for ​H​t​​2​,​ applying Eq. (E.1)
twice, first at t1 and second at t2, with M = H and X = P:
50
50
​H​t​​1​​= ____
​ ​(3119.7) + ____
​ ​(3117.5) = 3118.6

​H​t​​2​​ = ____
​ ​(3177.4) + ____
​ ​(3175.6) = 3176.5
100

A third linear interpolation between these values with M = t and X = H in
Eq. (E.1) yields:
3176.5 − 3150.6
3150.6 − 3118.6

Given this temperature, a table of entropy values can now be constructed:

As a check, one can apply Eq. (E.2) with M = H, X = t, and Y = P, confirming that
doing so produces H = 3150.6 kJ·kg−1.

These tables were generated by computer from programs1 based on “The 1976 International
Formulation Committee Formulation for Industrial Use: A Formulation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance,” as published in the ASME Steam Tables, 4th
ed., App. I, pp. 11–29, The Am. Soc. Mech. Engrs., New York, 1979. These tables served as
a world-wide standard for 30 years and are entirely adequate for instructional purposes. However, they have been replaced by the “International Association for the Properties of Water and
Steam Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam.”
These and other tables are discussed by A. H. Harvey and W. T. Parry, “Keep Your Steam
Tables Up to Date,” Chemical Engineering Progress, vol. 95, no. 11, p. 45, Nov. 1999.

1We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Professor Charles Muckenfuss, of Debra L. Sauke, and of Eugene
N. Dorsi, whose efforts produced the computer programs from which these tables derive.

UNIFAC Method

The UNIQUAC equation1 treats ​g ≡ ​G​E​/ RT​as the sum of two parts, a combinatorial
term gC to account for molecular size and shape differences, and a residual term gR (not a
residual property as defined in Sec. 6.2) to account for molecular interactions:
	​
g ≡ ​g​C​+ ​g​R​​	

(G.1)

Function gC contains pure-species parameters only, whereas function gR incorporates
two binary parameters for each pair of molecules. For a multicomponent system,

Subscript i identifies species, and j is a dummy index; all summations are over all species.
Note that ​​τ​ji​ ≠ ​τ​ij​;​however, when i = j, then ​​τ​ii​ = ​τ​jj​ = 1​. In these equations ri (a relative
molecular volume) and qi (a relative molecular surface area) are pure-species parameters. The
influence of temperature on g enters through the interaction parameters ​τ​ji​of Eq. (G.3), which
are temperature dependent:

​τ​ji​= exp​_______​​

Parameters for the UNIQUAC equation are therefore values of (uji − uii).

Again subscript i identifies species, and j and l are dummy indices. All summations are over
all species, and ​τ​ij​= 1 for i = j.​Values for the parameters ​(​u​ij​− ​u​jj​)​are found by regression of
binary VLE data and are given by Gmehling et al.2
The UNIFAC method for estimation of activity coefficients3 depends on the concept
that a liquid mixture may be considered a solution of the structural units from which the molecules are formed rather than a solution of the molecules themselves. These structural units are
called subgroups, and a few of them are listed in the second column of Table G.1. A number,
designated k, identifies each subgroup. The relative volume Rk and relative surface area Qk
are properties of the subgroups, and values are listed in columns 4 and 5 of Table G.1. Also
shown (columns 6 and 7) are examples of molecular species and their constituent subgroups.
When a molecule can be constructed from more than one set of subgroups, the set containing
the least number of different subgroups is the correct set. The great advantage of the UNIFAC
method is that a relatively small number of subgroups combine to form a very large number
of molecules.
Activity coefficients depend not only on the subgroup properties Rk and Qk, but also
on interactions between subgroups. Here, similar subgroups are assigned to a main group,
as shown in the first two columns of Table G.1. The designations of main groups, such as
“CH2,” “ACH,” etc., are descriptive only. All subgroups belonging to the same main group are

Appendix H
Newton’s Method

Newton’s method is a procedure for the numerical solution of algebraic equations, applicable
to any number M of such equations expressed as functions of M variables.
Consider first a single equation f (X) = 0, in which f (X) is a function of the single­
variable X. Our purpose is to find a root of this equation, that is, the value of X for which the
function is zero. A simple function is illustrated in Fig. H.1; it exhibits a single root at the
point where the curve crosses the X-axis. When it is not possible to solve directly for the root,1
a numerical procedure, such as Newton’s method, is employed.

APPENDIX H. Newton’s Method

The application of Newton’s method is illustrated in Fig. H.1. In the neighborhood of
an arbitrary value X = X0 the function f (X) can be approximated by the tangent line drawn at
X = X0. The equation of the tangent line is given by the linear relation:
df ​(​X​)​
​g​(​X​)​= f​​(​X0​ ​)​+ ​ ​_____
​ 
 ​
​ ​ ​​​(​X − ​X0​ ​)​
[ dX ]
X=​X​ ​
0

where g(X ) is the value of the ordinate at X, as shown in Fig. H.1. The root of this equation is
found by setting g(X ) = 0 and solving for X; as indicated in Fig. H.1, the value is X1. Because
the actual function is not linear, this is not the root of f (X). However, it lies closer to the root
than does the starting value X0. The function f (X) is now approximated by a second line,
drawn tangent to the curve at X = X1, and the procedure is repeated, leading to a root for this
linear approximation at X2, a value still closer to the root of f (X). This root can be approached
as closely as desired by continued successive linear approximation of the original function.
The general formula for iteration is:
df​(​ ​X)​ ​
	​
f​​(​Xn​ ​)​+ ​ ​____
​ 
 ​
​ ​ ​​Δ​Xn​ ​= 0​	
[ dX ]
X=​X​ ​

(H.1)

n

where
​Δ​Xn​ ​≡ ​Xn+1
​ ​− ​Xn​ ​   or   ​Xn+1
​ ​= ​Xn​ ​+ Δ​Xn​ ​
Equation (H.1), written for successive iterations (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), produces successive values
of ΔXn and successive values of f (Xn). The process starts with an initial value X0 and continues until either ΔXn or f (Xn), or some combination thereof, approaches zero to within a preset
tolerance.
Newton’s method is readily extended to the solution of simultaneous equations. For the
case of two equations in two unknowns, let fI ≡ fI(XI, XII) and fII ≡ fII(XI, XII) represent two
functions, the values of which depend on the two variables XI and XII. Our purpose is to find
the values of XI and XII for which both functions are zero. In analogy to Eq. (H.1), we write:
∂ ​fI​​
∂ ​fI​​
	​
​fI​​+ ​ _
​ ​ ​Δ​X​​+ ​ _
​ ​ ​Δ​X​ ​= 0​​	
( ∂ ​XI​​) I ( ∂ ​XII​ ​) II

(H.2a)

∂ ​fII​ ​
∂ ​fII​ ​
	​
​fII​ ​+ ​ _
​ ​ ​Δ​X​​+ ​ _
​ ​ ​Δ​X​ ​= 0​​	
( ∂ ​XI​​) I ( ∂ ​XII​ ​) II

(H.2b)

These equations differ from Eq. (H.1) in that the single derivative is replaced by two partial
derivatives, reflecting the rates of change of each function with each of the two variables. For
iteration n the two functions fI and fII and their derivatives are evaluated at X = Xn from the
given expressions, and Eqs. (H.2a) and (H.2b) are solved simultaneously for ΔXI and ΔXII.
These are specific to the particular iteration, and they lead to new values XI and XII, applicable
to the next iteration:
​X​I​​n+1​​= ​X​I​​n​​+ Δ​X​I​​n​​and ​X​I​I​n+1​​= ​X​I​I​n​​+ Δ​X​I​I​n​​
The iterative procedure based on Eqs. (H.2) is initiated with starting values for XI and XII and
continues until the increments ΔXIn and ΔXIIn or the computed values of fI and fII approach
zero.

APPENDIX H. Newton’s Method

Equations (H.2) can be generalized to apply to a system of M equations in M unknowns;
the result for each iteration is:
M ∂ ​f​ ​
k
	​
​fk​ ​+ ​  ∑ ​​​​​  _
​ ​ ​​Δ​XJ​ ​= 0   ​​(​K = I, II, . . . , M​)​​

​ ​​ = ​X​J​n​ ​​ + Δ​X​J​n​ ​   ​(​J = I, II, . . . , M​)​​	
Newton’s method is well suited to application to multireaction equilibria. As an illustration, we solve Eqs. (A) and (B) of Ex. 14.13 for the case of T = 1000 K. From these equations
with values given there for Ka and Kb at 1000 K and with P/P° = 20, we find the functions
	​
​fa​ ​= 4.0879 ​ε2​b​​  + ​ε2​b​​  + 4.0879 ​εa​ ​εb​ ​+ 0.2532 ​εa​ ​− 0.0439​ε​b​− 0.1486​

and
	​
​fb​ ​= 1.2805 ​ε2​b​​  + 2.12805 ​εa​ ​εb​ ​− 0.12805 ​εa​ ​+ 0.3048 ​εb​ ​− 0.4328​	

(B)

Equations (H.2) are written here as:
∂ ​fa​ ​
∂ ​fa​ ​
	​
​fa​ ​+ ​​ _
​ ​ ​​Δ​ε​ ​+ ​​ _
​ ​ ​​Δ​ε​ ​= 0​	
( ∂ ​εa​ ​) a ( ∂ ​εb​ ​) b

∂ ​fb​ ​
∂ ​fb​ ​
	​
​fb​ ​+ ​ _
​ ​ ​Δ​ε​ ​+ ​ ​_
​ ​ ​Δ​ε​ ​= 0​	
( ∂ ​εa​ ​) a ( ∂ ​εb​ ​) b

(D)

The solution procedure is initiated with a choice of starting values for εa and εb. Numerical
values are obtained for fa and fb and for their derivatives from Eqs. (A) and (B). Substitution
of these values in Eqs. (C) and (D) yields two linear equations which are readily solved for the
unknowns Δεa and Δεb. These yield new values of εa and εb with which to carry out a second
iteration. The process continues until Δεa and Δεb or fa and fb approach zero.
Setting εa = 0.1 and εb = 0.7 as starting values,2 we find initial values of fa and fb and
their derivatives from Eqs. (A) and (B):
∂ ​fa​ ​
∂ ​fb​ ​
f​a​ ​= 0.6630​    ​_
​ ​ ​​ = 3.9230    ​​_
​ ​ ​​ = 1.7648
( ∂ ​εa​ ​)
( ∂ ​εb​ ​)
      
​​
​​​
∂ ​fb​ ​
∂ ​fb​ ​
​fb​ ​= 0.4695​    ​_
​ ​ ​​ = 1.3616    ​_
​ ​ ​= 2.0956
( ∂ ​εa​ ​)
( ∂ ​εb​ ​ )
These values are substituted in Eqs. (C) and (D) to yield:
0.6630 + 3.9230Δ​εa​ ​+ 1.7648Δ​εb​ ​= 0
	​
​   ​
0.4695 + 1.3616Δ​εa​ ​+ 2.0956Δ​εb​ ​= 0
The values of the increments that satisfy these equations are:
​Δ​εa​ ​= − 0.0962   and   Δ​εb​ ​= − 0.1614​
2These are well within the limits, −0.5 ≤ ε ≤ 0.5 and 0 ≤ εb ≤ 1.0, noted in Ex. 14.13.

from which,
​εa​ ​= 0.1 − 0.0962 = 0.0038   and   ​εb​ ​= 0.7 − 0.1614 = 0.5386​
These values are the basis for a second iteration, and the process continues, yielding results as

Convergence is clearly rapid. Moreover, any reasonable starting values lead to convergence on
the same answers.
Convergence problems can arise with Newton’s method when one or more of the functions exhibit extrema. This is illustrated for the case of a single equation in Fig. H.2. The
function has two roots, at points A and B. If Newton’s method is applied with a starting value
of X smaller than a, a very small range of X values produces convergence on each root, but for
most values it does not converge, and neither root is found. With a starting value of X between
a and b, it converges on root A only if the value is sufficiently close to A. With a starting value
of X to the right of b, it converges on root B. In cases such as this, a proper starting value can
be found by trial, or by graphing the function to determine its behavior.
